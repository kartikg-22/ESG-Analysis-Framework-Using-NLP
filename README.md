# Analysing ESG report using Natural Language Processing

## Summary
Environment, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) refers to the three central factors in measuring the sustainability and societal impact of an investment in a company or business.  These criteria help to better determine the future financial performance of companies (return and risk).

This analysis extracts text from a ESG report in PDF format from the internet, performs NLP on these information, summaries the key ESG initiatives with Word Clouds, TDIDFs and discovers topics by building a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model.

To keep this exercise as simple as possible, only one ESG report is being used.  Specifically the [Citibank's 2019 ESG report](https://www.citigroup.com/citi/about/esg/download/2019/Global-ESG-Report-2019.pdf?ieNocache=967).  

Given that ESG is a broad topic.  Different companies focus on different aspects of ESG depending on their business operations and culture.  One can potentially ingest more ESG reports from different companies across all sectors and industries to capture relevant ESG topics.  This to be attempted in another analysis.
