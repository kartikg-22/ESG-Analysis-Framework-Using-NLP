Like others, we have mobilized to tackle the \nconsequences of a horrific war, including by stopping our work in \nRussia, relocating our people, and contributing $28 million\u2014inclusive \nof our $18 million cash donation to relevant organizations, and our \n$10\u00a0million commitment in pro bono support. We hope for a path to \npeace and to the rebuilding of lives and livelihoods.\n\nBob Sternfels speaking with McKinsey colleagues in Poznan, Poland in April 2022\n\nReflecting on 2021\n2021 was an extraordinary year as forces reshaped society, business, \nand the communities where we live and work. We saw progress \nin battling COVID-19, renewed commitment to our planet, and \nremarkable human resilience in balancing work, life priorities, and \nsocietal needs. It was a year when companies led with courage and \ntook greater responsibility to benefit all stakeholders. It was also a \nyear of personal transition as I became McKinsey\u2019s global managing \npartner. In my role, I see that the leadership challenge of this moment \nis to accelerate sustainable and inclusive growth for the world. We too \noften talk about trade-offs between growth on one hand and societal \nbenefits on the other. I believe the future belongs to those who can \ndrive growth that is both sustainable and inclusive. At McKinsey, we \nare working to do so with purpose.\n\nEnabling resilient growth \nWe believe that growth is necessary to secure increased prosperity \nand well-being for everyone. We drive growth as a holistic impact \npartner for our clients. We also drive growth through initiatives like \nour McKinsey Institute for Black Economic Mobility. Along with driving \ngrowth, building resilience for our clients, society and ourselves is a \npriority. Overlapping global disruptions are exhausting organizations, \ntheir people, and economic buffers. Therefore, building resilience is \nessential.\n\nInnovating to net zero\nWe aspire to be the world\u2019s largest private sector catalyst for \ndecarbonization. In 2021, we partnered with over 400 clients to support \ntheir climate transition and ESG journeys. We are pursuing science-\nbased targets to decarbonize our own operations by 2025 and achieve \nnet-zero impact by 2030. We continue to innovate our client service \nand create insights that help define the problem and shape the solution, \nsuch as our report on The Net-Zero Transition outlining what it will take \nto achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nIncreasing inclusion\nWe aim to create economic opportunity to reduce inequalities and enable \ninclusive growth. By investing in human capital in the same way we invest \nin physical capital, we can foster workforce diversity and reskill or upskill \npeople so they can thrive. As well as advising clients on diversity, equity, \nand inclusion, we are making progress across our firm\u2014in 2021, we \nelected our most diverse class of partners and senior partners.\n\nSetting the standard for our profession on accountability \nand\u00a0compliance\nWe continue to strengthen our risk management processes and culture.\nWe now have an \u201cindustry-first\u201d client service policy that requires we \nevaluate every engagement and client to determine if we will meet the \nhigh expectations and ethical standards our clients and others have of \nus\u2014and we have of ourselves.\n\nOn behalf of our 38,000+ colleagues in more than 65 countries, I am \nproud of the significant steps we have taken on our environmental, \nsocial, and governance (ESG) journey this past year. We have a new \nESG framework that builds on our sustainable, inclusive growth \nambition, established an ESG Council to maintain a sharp focus, and \nwe continue to evolve our external reporting\u2014including aligning \nwith the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) \nrecommendations for the first time.\n\nThroughout this report, you will find details about the progress we are \nmaking. While I am proud of what we have accomplished, I am even \nmore excited for what is still to come.\n\nBob Sternfels Global Managing Partner, McKinsey & Company\n\nMcKinsey 2021 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##4\n\nOverview\n\nOur insights\n\nOur clients\n\nOur people\n\nOur firm\n\nReporting\n\nAbout McKinsey\n\nMcKinsey is a global management consulting \nfirm committed to partnering with organizations \nto accelerate sustainable and inclusive growth. \n\nWe work with clients across the private, public, and social sectors \nto solve complex problems and create positive change for all \nstakeholders.

Danfoss, a global leader in \nenergy efficient components, has set an ambition to become their \ncustomers\u2019 preferred decarbonization partner. With a large portfolio \nof components and deep knowledge in three high emission sectors\u2014\nindustry, transport, and buildings\u2014Danfoss is seizing its position to \nsupport customers by enabling the energy transition. \n\nIn practice, this meant setting emissions reduction targets covering the \nentire value chain and developing circular products that minimize waste \nand emissions. For many industrial companies, including Danfoss, \nScope 3 emissions are both the largest part of their footprint and the \nmost complex to decarbonize. To understand the opportunities, \ncosts, and timelines of decarbonization, McKinsey partnered \nwith Danfoss to help develop the necessary insights, tools, and \ncapabilities to tackle its Scope 3 emissions. \n\nFirst, Danfoss set out to map emissions across the business and the \nvalue chain. The engagement team found that, like the company\u2019s \npeers, most emissions come from the use of sold products. The second \nlargest category of emissions are purchased goods. To understand the \nfull potential and cost of reducing Scope 3 emissions, Danfoss focused \nsimultaneously on its own operations, product development, and  \nsupply chain. \n\nIn product development, Danfoss\u2019 first step was to baseline embodied \ncarbon for each product category, using primary data from the \nsupply chain, where possible. Since, across all sectors, primary \nupstream Scope 3 data is a known challenge, the joint team used \nsecondary data where gaps existed. This work has enabled product \nmanagers and engineers to use carbon and cost impact assessments \nto create actionable decarbonization targets and roadmaps for \nindividual\u00a0products. \n\nAt the same time, Danfoss baselined the emissions in purchased goods, \nidentified the top emitting procurement categories and suppliers, and \nthen engaged with them to switch to lower emissions energy sources. \nTo enable the scaling of this approach to Danfoss\u2019 broader portfolio, \nMcKinsey helped to build a digital solution to estimate upstream \nemissions and enable more efficient prioritization and decision-making.\n\nDanfoss aims to embed its ESG ambition in all major business \nprocesses and engagement with the full value chain.

Vistra has committed to reducing emissions \nby 60 percent by 2030 (against a 2010 baseline) and achieving net-\nzero emissions by 2050. \n\nTo help achieve its goals for cleaner and more efficient power, Vistra \nturned to McKinsey to optimize its power plants using AI. The first \npart of the collaboration involved determining where AI could have \nthe biggest impact. McKinsey experts, data scientists, and analytics \ntranslators from QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, worked closely with \na Vistra team of power generation experts and frontline operators to \nunderstand how the plant works, what data was already available, and \nwhat variables could be controlled. \n\nOne solution was the \u201cHeat Rate Optimizer\u201d (HRO), a tool that helps \ndetermine the most efficient amount of electricity generated for each \nunit of fuel consumed. The model analyzed two years of data to learn \nwhich combination of external factors\u2014such as temperature and \nhumidity\u2014and internal decisions, like set points that operators control, \nwould attain the best heat-rate efficiency at any point in time. \n\n~1.6m  \n\ntons of carbon abated annually\n\n67      \n\npower plants optimized \n\n$60m \n\nsavings captured in the first year, as part \nof $250\u2013$300 million savings roadmap\n\nIn less than three months, the HRO improved efficiency by 2 percent\u2014\nrepresenting a major improvement over traditional improvement \nefforts. Typically, operators of gas-fueled power plants would invest \nmillions of dollars in research and development over four to five years to \nachieve a 1 percent improvement in power-generation efficiency.\n\nAdditional solutions have helped Vistra abate about 1.6 million tons of \ncarbon per year, equating to 10 percent of its remaining 2030 carbon \nreduction commitment. \n\nA critical ingredient has been the infrastructure put in place to scale \nthis work across Vistra\u2019s 60+ power-generation units. When a solution \nhas proven value at a pilot site, a team of software and machine learning \nengineers refactor, modularize, and containerize the code. This enables \na \u201ccore\u201d software package for each deployment that can be updated \nand improved while scaling. \n\nWe also worked with Vistra to implement a standardized approach \nto the deployment and maintenance of more than 400 AI models, \nsupporting the continuous improvement of each model to ensure the \nplants sustain and build on the value they captured (a practice known \nas MLOps\u2014short for Machine Learning Operations).\n\nWith more than $60 million in savings captured in the first year and \nanother $40\u00a0million in progress, Vistra is well on its way to deliver its \n$250\u2013$300 million savings roadmap and more than two million tons  \nof carbon abatement per year.\n\nMcKinsey 2021 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##25\n\nOverview\n\nOur insights\n\nOur clients\n\nOur people\n\nOur firm\n\nReporting\n\nIncreasing  \ninclusion\n\nWe have a deep and long-standing commitment  \nto advancing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)  . \nIt is critical for growth and is integral to our \nmission of helping clients make substantial, lasting \nperformance improvements.\nOur research on diversity set the path for us.

In fact, McKinsey research estimated 23 ventilators \nexisted\u00a0per 100,000 people in North America, the region with the \nmost\u00a0plentiful supply. \n\nTypical production lines were making five to seven ventilators a day.  \nTo support patients by responding to surging requests for \nventilators, medical device manufacturer Vyaire Medical needed \nto increase production to 700 units daily within weeks. Given the \nurgency of the need, and the complexity of the devices and their supply \nchains, an extraordinary effort was required. Vyaire engaged McKinsey \nto support it to dramatically increase capacity.\n\nMcKinsey worked with Vyaire to develop a plan to dramatically \nand rapidly increase ventilator production. Alongside our experts, \nproduction engineers re-validated basic manufacturing data and \nassumptions at Vyaire\u2019s Palm Springs, California, facility, and identified \noptimization measures, which quickly tripled production.\n\nThe team then began looking for additional capacity. They created a \npartnership with Spirit AeroSystems, whose furloughed workforce had \na transferable skill set, and identified a 55,000 square foot building \nin Wichita, Kansas. Launching the new production facility required \ncoordination of machinery, inbound logistics, outbound freight, \nquality control, assembly, testing facilities, and many other aspects. \nIt also depended on close collaboration with suppliers that provide \ncritical\u00a0components.\n\nAs it became evident that the Palm Springs plant had reached its \nproduction limit, the team decided to execute a \u201clift and shift\u201d operation \nto consolidate all production lines at the new Wichita plant. This \ncomplex plan was designed and completed in less than 10 days\u2014a \nremarkable accomplishment given various circumstances. \n\nBy October 2020, total daily production rates exceeded 1,000 units \nand, at peak output, Vyaire was able to produce more ventilators in \nthree days than its entire 2019 output. Beyond delivering critical-care \nventilators, employment was provided for thousands of furloughed \nworkers both directly and through the supply chain. \n\n700     \n\nventilator units required \nto be produced daily to \nsupport\u00a0patients\n\n1,000+    \n\nventilator units produced \ndaily following McKinsey\u2019s \nengagement \n\nMcKinsey 2021 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##30\n\nOverview\n\nOur insights\n\nOur clients\n\nOur people\n\nOur firm\n\nReporting\n\nCASE STUDY  \nTelkomsel: Closing the \u2018digital \ndivide\u2019 through inclusive growth\n\n24m     \n\nmonthly active users \non MyTelkomsel app \n\n10x\n\nincrease compared \nto previous app\n\nThe Indonesian digital economy has emerged as a major driver of local \nmanufacturing and jobs, accounting for $32 billion annually\u2014the nation \nis also home to the fastest-growing population of smartphone users in \nthe world. \n\n\u2022   build new businesses that give customers more control of their \n\naccounts and easier online access \n\n\u2022  establish a new digital channel that would streamline how Telkomsel\u2019s \n\nservices are accessed\n\nTelkomsel, the world\u2019s seventh-largest mobile operator and the \nlargest in Southeast Asia, has been a driver of economic growth. \nThe provider has been central to the creation of a sustainable and \ninclusive digital economy for Indonesia\u2019s nearly 200 million internet \nusers.

Scope 1 covers all direct GHG \nemissions, such as fugitive emissions and those from combustion in owned or controlled boilers, diesel backup generators, and vehicles. Scope 2 covers indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, heat, or steam. Scope 3 encompasses other indirect emissions, such as those from business travel, upstream emissions from \npurchased fuels and electricity (for example, well-to-tank emissions, transmission, and distribution losses), and emissions related to purchased goods, vehicles not owned or controlled, outsourced activities, and waste disposal. Based on the impact of COVID-19 on our offices globally in 2021, we also included emissions associated with the use of \nvideo conferencing and other digital services as well as the use of electricity and heating at home during work time. Scope 1 and 2 emissions were calculated using survey data covering 97 percent of our offices. Scope 3 emissions were calculated based on mileage (air travel, ground transportation, and employee commuting), stay duration (hotels), \nenergy consumption (related to work from home, cloud computing, and upstream emissions from purchased fuels and electricity), spend (purchased goods and outsourced activities) and survey data (waste disposal and consumption of water bottles).

Underscoring this commitment, we \nbecame a participant of the United Nations Global Compact in 2018. \nWe comply with the anti-corruption laws of all the jurisdictions in which \nwe operate, including the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK \nBribery Act. \n\nWe expect our leaders to model our values and professional standards, \nincluding, among other principles, inclusivity and allyship, ethical \nbehavior, and apprenticeship. \n\nAddressing potential violations and breaches\nAny potential allegation of the firm\u2019s ethical standards is subject to \ncomprehensive investigation. Substantiation of violations of McKinsey\u2019s \nCode of Professional Conduct and firm policies can lead to disciplinary \naction up to and including termination.\n\nGrievance mechanisms\nEvery firm member has the right and obligation to raise concerns about \nvalues, ethics, and professional conduct without fear of retribution. Our \naspiration is to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable \nseeking advice or raising concerns directly with a\u00a0colleague. \n\nThe firm\u2019s anti-corruption efforts are overseen at a board level by the \nRisk, Audit, and Governance Committee, along with other relevant \ncommittees. Our Compliance team shapes and manages related \ninternal firm practices, in close partnership with specialists on our \nLegal team. In 2021, a new global chief compliance officer joined the \nfirm as we continue enhancing our program governance. \n\nTo ensure consistency and fairness, we have a clear governance \nstructure and approach to consequence management for all firm \nmembers.

For those instances, \nour global hotline allows colleagues to raise concerns relating to \npotential violations of the law and the firm\u2019s policies, professional \nstandards, and values in a confidential manner and, where legally \npermissible,\u00a0anonymously. \n\nAdditionally, firm ombuds are available to all colleagues to provide \ninformal, confidential advice and address any concerns they may have. \nThese channels are communicated within every firm policy, our Code of \nProfessional Conduct, the firm\u2019s intranet channel, and context-specific \nguidance in our firm learning programs.\n\nThird-party compliance\nWe work to build and maintain the trust of the clients we serve, the \ncommunities in which we operate, and the talented people who join \nour firm.

For \nexample, we have an Affinity Group Advisory Committee\u2014composed \nof senior leaders representing relevant stakeholder groups\u2014that \ncollaborates to advance our supplier diversity program.\n\nSupplier screening and assessments \nDuring supplier sourcing and selection stages, our standard request for \nproposal templates utilized by our sourcing team include a questionnaire \nused to screen potential suppliers on practices and policies in areas \nincluding environmental sustainability, DEI, and data\u00a0privacy.\n\nAs a global firm with offices in more than \n65 countries, we have a significant opportunity \nand responsibility to drive positive social and \nenvironmental impact through our buying \nchoices and practices. \nWe continue to strengthen our practices, and engage with suppliers on \nreducing emissions to address climate change and on creating a supply \nchain that promotes diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). McKinsey \nstrives to partner with suppliers that share our values and commitment \nto responsible\u00a0conduct.\n\nSupplier standards and values \nWe seek to partner with and buy from suppliers that adhere to the \nsame level of integrity and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) \nstandards to which we hold ourselves. Our\u00a0Supplier Code of Conduct \n(the Code) is available in ten languages and sets the standards and \nvalues we expect, including to: \n\u2022  act ethically and with integrity\n\u2022  maintain data privacy and security\n\u2022  embrace inclusion and diversity\n\u2022  ensure fair employment and wages\n\u2022  reduce environmental impact\n\u2022  provide working conditions that support safety, well-being, and health\n\nNew suppliers26 go through a rigorous onboarding process that \nincludes risk-based due diligence to ensure the supplier follows \napplicable laws and meets our standards. We carry out periodic \ndiligence checks to assess changes in suppliers\u2019 circumstances \nat intervals determined by the suppliers\u2019 risk profile. In 2021, we \nlaunched a new supplier onboarding platform that further enhances \nour ESG screening and monitoring capabilities, including a \nquestionnaire for suppliers with a potentially higher ESG risk based \non considerations such as spend level, country risk, and category \nrisk. Existing suppliers selected based upon spend and risk level will \nbe recertified on the platform in 2022. We plan to use data collected \nthrough this platform to strengthen future\u00a0reporting.\n\nOur approach\n\nMcKinsey\u2019s Sustainable Procurement program sits within our \nResponsible Buying program, which is led by our Optimize team \nwith oversight by our chief financial officer. Optimize enables our \nResponsible Buying program through various services covering travel, \nevents, real estate, sourcing, technology, purchasing, and more.\n\nThe Responsible Buying program integrates ESG, risk, and operations \nrequirements into our procurement processes. It includes training for \nour colleagues and engagement with our suppliers on key topics. The \nprogram is designed to be holistic and to make it easy for colleagues \nand suppliers to make more responsible buying choices.\n\nDuring onboarding, we ask suppliers to agree to the Code or indicate \nthat they have a comparable code in place. Our standard contract \ntemplate for supplier services incorporates the Code and sets out our \nexpectations of suppliers.\n\nMcKinsey\u2019s global Sustainable Procurement Policy outlines our \nambition to deliver positive social and environmental impact through \nour selection, purchase, use, and disposal of products and services, \nand through the way in which we work with our suppliers to improve the \nsocial and environmental impact of the goods and services they offer.\n\nTraining for procurement colleagues\nIn 2021, we deployed a new training program called Buying \nResponsibly to all colleagues on our Procurement team. The mandatory \ntraining addresses the full buying life cycle and highlights how ESG \nconsiderations should be integrated throughout the process. By\u00a0the \nend of 2021, 93\u00a0percent of eligible procurement colleagues had \ncompleted this\u00a0training.\n\n26   Some exceptions apply (for example, hotels paid indirectly via reimbursement to colleagues, for which an alternative third-party vetting process is utilized).\n\nMcKinsey 2021 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##64\n\nOverview\n\nOur insights\n\nOur clients\n\nOur people\n\nOur firm\n\nReporting\n\nAdvancing supplier diversity\n\nWe believe that our supply chain should reflect the diversity of the \ncommunities in which we live and work. By the end of 2021, we had \nachieved 67 percent of our 10\u00a0Actions \nwith diverse suppliers27 within three years.28 \n\n goal to double our spending \n\nTo drive progress toward our goal, we are growing our network of \nsupplier diversity champions, building action plans within many top-\nspend categories, developing relationships with our existing diverse \nsuppliers, and communicating this issue\u2019s importance to many of our \nlargest suppliers. For example, in 2021, McKinsey\u2019s Technology and \ndigital function adopted a more purposeful reseller strategy, redirecting \nspend from a large, fragmented group of IT resellers to a smaller \nnumber of diverse-owned suppliers that have been providing high-\nquality service. By the end of 2021, we achieved around $36\u00a0million \ngrowth in net new spend with diverse-owned IT suppliers, procuring \nhardware, software, and professional services. \n\nTo broaden the reach of our supplier diversity program, we engage in \npartnerships with organizations such as the National Minority Supplier \nDevelopment Council, Women\u2019s Business Enterprise National Council, \nWEConnect International, Supply Nation, Minority Supplier Development \nUK, and others that support and promote supplier diversity. \n\nBeyond our procurement practices, we aim to use McKinsey\u2019s \nunique capabilities and resources to help strengthen diverse-owned \nbusinesses. McKinsey Inclusive Business Accelerator (MIBA) \n, an \ninitiative led by our Operations Practice, seeks to advance racial equity \nand economic empowerment in the United States by serving small- \nand medium-sized Black-owned businesses and their leaders. The \ninitiative offers capability building, networking opportunities, and fee-\nfree consulting support on operations topics. In 2021, MIBA Empower \nevents were attended by over 600\u00a0Black business leaders, including \nBlack executives and owners of Black-owned small- and medium-sized \nbusinesses. Now in its second year, MIBA has continued to provide fee-\nfree consulting services to Black-owned businesses across industries \nto help them further grow their success. \n\nDriving supplier environmental sustainability\n\nBeyond integrating ESG principles and requirements into procurement \nprocesses and decisions, we are committed to partnering with our \nsuppliers to share what we have learned from our own sustainability \njourney to help improve the social and environmental impact of the \ngoods and services they offer. Since indirect emissions from travel \naccount for more than 80 percent of our carbon footprint, we have \nmade engaging with our travel-related suppliers on sustainability \nissues a focus. We continue exploring opportunities with our \nsuppliers\u2014including more than 50 of the world\u2019s largest airlines and \nhotel groups\u2014to rebuild better together and provide our colleagues \nwith more sustainable options as we return to business travel.\n\nSustainability topics we have discussed with our travel suppliers include \nsetting science-based targets, transitioning to SAFs, reducing single-\nuse plastics, and switching to renewable energy sources. Through our \nGreen Hotels sustainable procurement strategy, we engage the top \nhotel chains in our supply chain and collect environmental sustainability \ninformation from over 1,000 hotel properties as part of our annual \nrequest for proposal process.\n\nIn 2021, we received an A score on CDP\u2019s Supplier Engagement Rating, \nreflecting our commitment to engaging suppliers on climate change \nand supporting the transition toward a net-zero economy.\n\n1,000+    \n\nhotel properties engaged  \non sustainability\n\n30+    \n\nkey suppliers engaged on their \nown supplier diversity practices\n\n15+     \n\nnon-diverse suppliers \ncollaborating on Tier\u00a02 reporting\n\n27   Diverse suppliers are defined as those that are 51%+ owned, operated, controlled, and managed by diverse individuals\u2014for example, minority-, woman-, veteran-, disability-, and LGBTQ+-owned businesses.\n28    Applies to specific categories of diverse suppliers.

Developed around four core elements\u2014governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets\u2014the recommendations support communication about \nhow a company is responding to change and the resilience of its strategies. This year marks the first time McKinsey is reporting in line with TCFD recommendations. \n\nDisclosure recommendation  \n\nDisclosure\n\nGovernance \na)  Describe the board\u2019s \noversight of climate-\nrelated risks and \nopportunities\n\nb)  Describe \n\nmanagement\u2019s role \nin assessing and \nmanaging climate-\nrelated risks and \nopportunities\n\nThe Risk, Audit, and Governance Committee (RAGC) of our Shareholders Council, which is equivalent to other companies\u2019 board of directors, has ultimate oversight of the firm\u2019s environmental \nsustainability matters, including climate-related issues. Its remit includes reviewing and guiding the firm\u2019s ESG strategy, annual budgets, setting performance objectives, and monitoring and \noverseeing progress against climate-related goals. For example, in 2021, RAGC approved the firm\u2019s science-based targets (SBTs) to reduce our GHG emissions in line with a 1.5 degree Celsius \npathway and our commitment to reach net-zero climate impact by 2030. McKinsey has a designated senior partner responsible for leading our ESG and Global Social Responsibility efforts, \nincluding all of the firm\u2019s efforts toward environmental sustainability and climate-related risks and opportunities. This individual provides periodic updates to the RAGC.\n\nThe Director of Acting Responsibly is responsible for measuring our GHG footprint annually, analyzing the results and assessing opportunities to reduce further our GHG footprint, elevating \nthese opportunities to the relevant leaders within the firm, implementing these opportunities throughout the firm, or working with relevant cells (geographic offices, industries, functional \npractices, and growth platforms) to implement them, ensuring that our targets/commitments/progress are in line with latest climate science, and proactively identifying and addressing any \nrisks related to climate change/environmental sustainability that will impact the firm. This individual reports into the senior partner leading ESG and Global Social Responsibility\u00a0efforts.\nIn 2021, RAGC approved additional governing bodies to our ESG oversight structure, spanning across an ESG Council, represented by senior firm functional, regional, and client service \nleaders. The ESG Council defines our ESG priorities, sets our strategy, and monitors progress, and is supported by the ESG Working Group and ESG Next-Generation Group to help \noperationalize the strategy and embed ESG initiatives across the firm. \nAdditionally, local managing partners are responsible for leading each geographic location to achieve our global commitments and strategy. Within each of our offices, the local managing \npartner has responsibility for the environmental footprint and climate impact of the office\u2019s operations, and for ensuring that the office contributes toward achieving the firm\u2019s SBTs.\n\nMcKinsey 2021 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##75\n\nTCFD Index \n\nDisclosure recommendation  \n\nDisclosure\n\nOverview\n\nOur insights\n\nOur clients\n\nOur people\n\nOur firm\n\nReporting\n\nStrategy \na)  Describe the climate-\n\nrelated risks and \nopportunities the \norganization has \nidentified over the \nshort, medium, and \nlong term\n\nMcKinsey considers climate-related risks and opportunities across short- (0\u20131 years), medium- (1\u20133 years), and long-term (3\u20138 years) horizons as part of our business strategy, covering three \nareas: our internal operations, our client service, and our knowledge work. As we continue to refine our approach to identifying and assessing these risks and opportunities, we will take into \naccount further long-term horizons (for example, until 2050).\nRisks \nClimate risk assessment is integrated into multi-disciplinary, firmwide risk management processes. As we assess these risks, we continue to evolve our capabilities and are developing a \ncomprehensive physical and transition risk assessment involving all relevant stakeholders within the firm, including our client service lines, to further inform our risk processes. We continue to \nidentify and monitor climate-related risks to ensure no major disruptions to our operating model. The risks we identified include:\nTransition risks\n\u2022\u2022  Legal and regulatory risk: As a global firm, we operate in 65+ countries, most of which have climate change laws or policies. We monitor current and emerging policy, regulatory, and legal \nrisks, to understand how McKinsey may be affected. \n\u2022\u2022 Technology risk: McKinsey considers technology part of our environmental footprint strategy, particularly in relation to how it can be used to reduce GHG emissions. As a service-based firm, \nIT is also paramount to our core operations and is therefore considered as part of business-as-usual risk assessments.\n\u2022\u2022 Reputation risk: McKinsey\u2019s reputation in this field is built on our client work, as well as the large body of often publicly available research and tools on climate change issues. Maintaining this \nreputation helps to support the opportunities for our practice across a number of areas, particularly for our sustainability-focused client service platform McKinsey Sustainability.\nPhysical risks\n\u2022\u2022 Weather events and shifts in climate patterns: As a global firm operating in 65+ countries, McKinsey is located in areas that may be exposed to acute physical risks related to climate change, \nsuch as extreme weather events, hurricanes, cyclones, floods, and temperature extremes, as well as chronic risks such as sea-level rise and heat stress. As part of our business continuity \nplanning and firm security programs, we consider both acute and chronic climate risks to our offices and operations, IT networks, and colleague safety.\n\nMcKinsey 2021 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##76\n\nTCFD Index \n\nDisclosure recommendation  \n\nDisclosure\n\nOverview\n\nOur insights\n\nOur clients\n\nOur people\n\nOur firm\n\nReporting\n\na)  Describe the climate-\n\nrelated risks and \nopportunities the \norganization has \nidentified over the \nshort, medium, and \nlong term \n(cont.)\n\nOpportunities \nMcKinsey identified climate-related opportunities that may have an impact on the firm in the medium term. Specifically, we identified: \n\u2022\u2022  Development of new platforms for client service and research: Sustainability is among the top priorities on our clients\u2019 agendas. McKinsey Sustainability is the firm\u2019s client service platform \nwith the goal of helping all industry sectors transform to get to net zero by 2050, and to cut carbon emissions by half by 2030. As an advisory firm, McKinsey has the opportunity to provide \nconsulting advice to clients through McKinsey Sustainability on climate-related topics, including, for example: \n\u2022 managing the transition to a low-carbon, sustainable growth economy \n\u2022 adapting to climate change\n\u2022 capturing emerging opportunities in energy, water, waste, and land use \n\u2022 harnessing the potential of clean technologies to create smarter systems, new jobs, and competitive advantage \n\u2022 capitalizing on evolving shifts in urban mobility \n\u2022 capturing benefits of circular economy \nOur recent acquisitions of Vivid Economics, Planetrics, and Material Economics brings new experts, analytics, and capabilities to assess climate risk, develop sustainable strategies, navigate \neconomic shifts, and create value through sustainable transformations.\n\nMcKinsey 2021 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##77\n\nTCFD Index \n\nDisclosure recommendation  \n\nDisclosure\n\nOverview\n\nOur insights\n\nOur clients\n\nOur people\n\nOur firm\n\nReporting\n\nb)  Describe the impact of \n\nclimate-related risks \nand opportunities \non the organization\u2019s \nbusinesses, strategy, \nand financial planning\n\nRisks\nWe continue to identify and monitor climate-related risks and have not yet identified any with the potential to have an immediate disruption to overall firm operations. As an advisory firm, our \n\u201cassets\u201d are not physical locations in the traditional sense but our proprietary knowledge and reputation, and people. Given the limited physical assets, the physical hazard impact of climate \nchange on the firm is likely low. Similarly, at this time transition risks identified, including current and emerging regulation, reputational, technology, and market risks, are unlikely to present \nsubstantive impact to the firm. We recognize changes in climate could lead to possible shifts in the geographies or industries in which we serve clients today, which could have an impact on our \noverall business strategy, and we are continually monitoring these potential risks.\nAlthough the impacts to our direct footprint and operations are likely low, we take a proactive approach to risk management by implementing programs to mitigate some risks, such as security \nand safety risks, including those related to climate events, as well as measuring, addressing, and publicly reporting our carbon footprint. In addition, we continue to enhance our climate risk \nidentification and assessment capabilities, including more advanced scenario analysis.\nOpportunities\nClimate-related opportunities influence our business strategy in relation to: \n\u2022\u2022   our client service, that is, developing McKinsey Sustainability, our sustainability-focused client service platform \n\u2022\u2022  our investment in research and development (R&D) through a dedicated internal research function developing cutting-edge knowledge to support McKinsey Sustainability \n\u2022\u2022  our internal operations such as procurement, that is, developing a responsible procurement strategy for engagement with suppliers to improve the environmental and social impact of the \ngoods and services they offer, and Environmental Sustainability strategy\u2014that is, our commitments to achieve our near-term science-based targets\nThese opportunities are considered in financial planning and have not been deemed to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on the firm in the short term.\n\nMcKinsey 2021 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##78\n\nTCFD Index \n\nDisclosure recommendation  \n\nDisclosure\n\nOverview\n\nOur insights\n\nOur clients\n\nOur people\n\nOur firm\n\nReporting\n\nc)  Describe the resilience \n\nof the organization\u2019s \nstrategy, taking into \nconsideration different \nclimate related \nscenarios, including a \n2\u00b0C or lower scenario\n\nAs part of our strategic planning processes, we seek to understand how different climate scenarios impact McKinsey\u2019s business risks and opportunities. \nTo inform our business strategy, we model emission reduction pathways under various climate scenarios while also considering the firm\u2019s growth trajectory, the impact of the global pandemic, \ntrends in our activity drivers and associated emissions, clients\u2019 and colleagues\u2019 expectations, and the evolution of working models and business technology. \nFollowing the analysis, we are taking action to strengthen the resilience of our strategy, to be better prepared and positioned for evolving climate-related risks and opportunities.\nFor example, we have set our goals for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions reductions in line with the Science Based Targets initiative\u2019s (SBTi) methodology for reductions required to align with the \nParis Agreement\u2019s 1.5 degree Celsius pathway. Across all scopes, we are working to reduce our emissions, including by increasing our use of renewable electricity and electric vehicles, \nreducing business travel, and supporting sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs). In line with these commitments, we are making shifts to our business strategy and operating model to improve our \nresilience, including to the ways in which we serve our clients, such as introducing hybrid and remote alternative ways of working, and promoting more sustainable travel options.\nOver time, we will continue to regularly assess the resilience of our strategy against evolving risks and opportunities, and continue to strengthen our approach. We will also work to identify \nrealistic management approaches and develop action plans under the different climate scenarios to embed responses into business-as-usual activity.\n\nRisk Management  \na)  Describe the \norganization\u2019s \nprocesses for \nidentifying and \nassessing climate-\nrelated risks\n\nMcKinsey considers climate-related risks and opportunities as part of its environmental footprint strategy, covering three areas: internal operations, client service, and knowledge work. \nClimate risk identification and assessment is integrated into firmwide enterprise risk management, and outputs are taken into consideration as the firm defines business continuity and \noperational resilience requirements and actions. Risk and opportunity identification is embedded within the firm\u2019s \u201ccells\u201d (geographic offices, industries, functional practices, and growth \nplatforms), which are most similar to the traditional meaning of \u201cassets\u201d within an organization. Specifically, the local managing partners are responsible for identifying and evaluating risks \narising from the operations of their local offices (with support from the broader firm), including climate-related risks, which they do through local operating committees and management \nteams. \n\nMcKinsey 2021 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##79\n\nTCFD Index \n\nDisclosure recommendation  \n\nDisclosure\n\nOverview\n\nOur insights\n\nOur clients\n\nOur people\n\nOur firm\n\nReporting\n\nb)  Describe the \norganization\u2019s \nprocesses for \nmanaging climate-\nrelated risks\n\nc)  Describe how \nprocesses for \nidentifying, assessing, \nand managing climate-\nrelated risks are \nintegrated into the \norganization\u2019s overall \nrisk management\n\nWe prioritize management of our climate-related risks and opportunities based on their materiality to McKinsey at a firmwide level and at an organizational cluster level. Factors considered \nto determine the materiality and priority include legal and regulatory compliance, our clients\u2019 and societal expectations, the impact on our talent strategy, potential to catalyze environmental \nimpact, financial risk (for example, whether climate change has an impact on the value of our assets or reputation), and physical risk to our assets and operations. For risks to our own \noperations, this is informed by rigorous annual measurement and third-party verification of our emissions.\nAs an example of adaptation for physical risks today, we have a monitoring program to identify extreme weather/other risks, and proactively reach out to local offices to ensure that they are \naware of impending extreme weather events and taking steps to communicate with colleagues. This monitoring continues to improve over time, but has been reliably in place for a number of \nyears. Examples of other preparations include documented guidance for extreme weather, scenario training for local security coordinators and leadership, as well as reviews of our physical \npremises to ensure they are consistent with firm standards. \n\nWe continually seek ways to better identify, analyze, and mitigate risk. Central to our approach is our risk framework, which provides the insight, integration, and technology we need to \nanticipate and proactively address risks. \nWe routinely and systematically undertake risk assessments, which include climate where relevant. These reviews incorporate diverse qualitative and quantitative inputs as well as \nexternal benchmarks to produce a comprehensive view of risk. They also inform the integration of risk mitigation work across McKinsey. In addition, we continue to enhance our climate risk \nidentification and assessment capabilities, including more advanced scenario analysis.\nOur collective risk management functions\u2014which include Enterprise Risk Management and specialist risk areas\u2014are overseen by McKinsey\u2019s Chief Risk Officer.\n\nMcKinsey 2021 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##80\n\nTCFD Index \n\nDisclosure recommendation  \n\nDisclosure\n\nOverview\n\nOur insights\n\nOur clients\n\nOur people\n\nOur firm\n\nReporting\n\nMcKinsey provides annual updates on climate-related metrics, including Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions, emissions intensity (market-based GHG emissions per capita), and energy \nand electricity use, including renewable electricity use, in our annual Environmental, Social, and Governance Report.

The footprint was calculated by \nSouth Pole and McKinsey and covers all Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions \nreported by McKinsey as material to its business. This includes \nemissions from company facilities, fugitive emissions and mobile \ncombustion, office electricity and heating usage, and from business \ntravel, purchased goods and services, transportation and freight, \nand waste generation. For Scope 3, the verification was restricted to \ncovering only business air travel, which is the main source of emissions \nacross the whole footprint.\n\nBoth the data within the footprint and the system used to produce the \nfootprint (by South Pole) were assessed during the verification process. \nVerification was carried out in accordance with BS ISO\u00a014064-3:2012 \nas a \u2018light touch\u2019 limited level of assurance, i.e., desk review of a \nrepresentative proportion of the entire data record, against the \nGHG\u00a0Protocol Corporate Standard. \n\nThe verification process included checking and assessing the following:\n\nTable 1: Scope of GHG emissions\n\n\u2022  Original data records against data reported in the footprint;\n\u2022  Data conversion, calculations, emission factors and assumptions;\u00a0and\n\u2022  Quality assurance processes and maintenance of the system.\n\nTemple verifiers found no evidence of material errors, omissions, \nor misstatements in McKinsey\u2019s GHG footprint nor are we aware of \nany material modifications that should be made. McKinsey\u2019s overall \nreported\u00a0GHG footprint (183,217 tonnes CO2e market-based and \n199,550\u00a0tonnes CO2e location-based) is therefore considered to be \nan accurate representation of the emissions associated with their \nglobal\u00a0operations.\n\nTemple subsequently verified the retirement of carbon credits made \non behalf of McKinsey to offset the GHG emissions from its global \noperations in 2021 in accordance with The Carbon Neutral Protocol. \nAll carbon credits been verified either under the Gold Standard for \nthe Global Goals (VER credits) or under the Verified Carbon Standard \n(VCUs). McKinsey\u2019s overall reported carbon credit retirement of \n183,867 tonnes CO2e is considered sufficient to offset its 2021 GHG \nfootprint in full (183,217 tonnes CO2e market-based).\n\nScope\nScope 1\n(100% of total scope emissions verified)\nScope 2\n(100% of total scope emissions verified)\nScope 3\n(64% of total scope emissions verified)\n\nVerified total \n(tonnes CO2e)\n12,191\n\nPercentage \ndifference\n0.0%\n\n17,172\n\n111,398\n\n0.0%\n\n0.0%\n\nDr Caitlin Taylor Consultant\n\n \n\nDr Xiangyu Sheng Director Air Quality & Climate change\n\nStephen Glenny Principal Consultant\n\nMcKinsey 2021 ESG Report\f##PAGE_BREAK##Learn more online at: \nmckinsey.com/about-us/social-responsibility \n\n \n\nWe welcome your comments and questions \nregarding this report.
