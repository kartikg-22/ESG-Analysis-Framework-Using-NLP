And for those whose \njobs aren\u2019t directly within a sustainability field, we offer \nupskilling programs and affinity groups where our employees \ncan learn more and get involved. It\u2019s thanks to the thousands \nof professionals working behind-the-scenes across Amazon \nthat we are able to bring all of this amazing work to life. \n\nI\u2019m proud of the work that\u2019s underway, and truly excited \nfor\u00a0what\u2019s to come. \n\nWith gratitude,\nKara Hurst \nChief Sustainability Officer\n\nAt Amazon, we are always looking for ways to move faster, \ndeliver the best possible customer experience, and innovate. \nWe regularly hear from our customers, corporate partners, \nand employees how much they care about sustainability and \nsocial responsibility. For a company as diverse as Amazon, \nembedding these values into all of our businesses, products, \nand services\u2014as well as how we deliver for our customers\u2014\nhas been an incredible undertaking, with much of it taking \nplace behind-the-scenes. \n\nProgress is likely easiest to spot in our Stores business. \nOur\u00a0customers let us know that their Amazon packages are \nnow arriving at their doorsteps faster, with less packaging, \nand delivered by more electric delivery vehicles than ever \nbefore. By regionalizing our operations and transportation \nnetworks in the U.S., we can now deliver items faster and \nat lower costs. This also allows us to minimize or avoid \nextra packaging altogether, while reducing the distance a \npackage has to travel, cutting back on the carbon emissions \nassociated with deliveries. \n\nWe also know our customers look to Amazon to be a leader \namong our peers. On renewable energy, we set an ambitious \ngoal to match 100% of the electricity consumed by our \nglobal operations with renewable energy by 2030, and \nwe reached that goal in 2023\u2014seven years early. As we \nlook to the future, we are steadfast in our Climate Pledge \ncommitment to be net-zero carbon across our operations \nby 2040. We will continue to lead and invest in creating \ncarbon-free energy around the world at scale, including \nthrough solar, wind, nuclear, and other emerging energy \ntechnologies. Our progress toward a net-zero carbon \nbusiness will not be linear, and each year as our various \nbusinesses grow and evolve, we will produce different \nresults. These results will be influenced by significant \nchanges to our business, investments in growth, and \n\nmeeting the needs of our customers. Through it all, we will \nremain steadfast as we invent, adapt, and will our way to \nmeeting our commitment to The Climate Pledge.   \n\nWe know that driving change means staying focused on \nbringing entire industries along with us. Over the past five \nyears, we\u2019ve done this by encouraging companies to join \nThe Climate Pledge\u2014and we\u2019re proud that over 500 have \njoined us and committed to be net-zero carbon 10 years \nahead of the Paris Agreement. But we wanted to do more. \nMost recently, our sustainability team has been developing \nresources to share our expertise and help our suppliers build, \nmeasure, and act on their sustainability commitments. That\u2019s \nwhy we\u2019ve launched the Amazon Sustainability Exchange, a \nfree sustainability resource center that contains a number of \nAmazon\u2019s previously proprietary playbooks, templates, case \nstudies, and science models, among other sustainability best \npractices. \n\nLooking ahead, we know our customers look to us to be \nat the cutting edge of new and growing technologies and \nenable them for good. We\u2019re already deploying artificial \nintelligence (AI) in ways that benefit our customers directly, \nsuch as using it to right-size packaging and avoid waste. \nWe\u2019re exploring a growing number of AI applications\u2014\nwhether it\u2019s monitoring and optimizing our energy use \nor helping combat deforestation in Brazil. We also see an \nopportunity to use AI to address sustainability challenges at \nan unprecedented scale, all while delivering new solutions \nfor our customers. Much work remains, and we\u2019re excited \nthat Amazon is uniquely positioned to figure out how AI \ncan help us address climate change in a more efficient and \nresponsible\u00a0way.\n\nMost importantly, we need to continue to invest in talent and \nhire employees who can lead on sustainability. We\u2019re proud \n\nIntroduction2023 Year in ReviewGoals SummaryHow We WorkCSO LetterOverviewEnvironment2023 Amazon Sustainability Report Value Chain\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n5\n\nHow We Work \nHow We Work\n\nOur Mission\n\nTo make customers\u2019 lives better and easier every day.\n\nOur Business\nWe are committed to addressing \nsustainability at every stage of\nour value chain.\n\nOur Operations\nWe o\ufb00er products and services\u2014both \nAmazon-branded and from many other \nbrands and third-party sellers\u2014in our \nAmazon stores, leveraging advanced \ntransportation logistics to deliver \nglobally.

These are some \nof the reasons we co-founded and committed to The Climate \nPledge in 2019\u2014our goal to reach net-zero carbon emissions \nby 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement\u2014and have \ninvited hundreds of companies to join us.\n\nAmazon has a variety of businesses touching many sectors, \nsome of which rely on carbon-intensive industries to provide \ncritical goods and services to our customers. However, we \nbelieve the complexity of our business puts us in a unique \nposition to be a leader in decarbonization strategies. We \nhave an opportunity to demonstrate how achieving net-\nzero carbon emissions is possible across many sectors, while \ncreating solutions that benefit our business as well as the \nindustries in which we operate. \n\nFoundationally, our strategy relies on embedding \ndecarbonization initiatives and efficiency improvements \nacross our business. Our comprehensive approach to \nreducing and avoiding carbon emissions focuses on key \nsectors of our business, including delivery and logistics; \nbuilding construction and operations; servers and hardware; \ngrocery, products, and devices; and packaging. Teams across \nAmazon are accountable for setting decarbonization plans \nthat map back to Amazon\u2019s worldwide strategy because \nownership and accountability are critical to operational \nsuccess and managing complexity. We focus on four \ncrosscutting initiatives to decarbonize our business: \n\n\u2022  We focus first on driving efficiency across our \n\noperations to reduce and avoid emissions at scale. This \nincludes improving transportation routing, increasing \npack and fill rates, improving cloud-computing chip \nefficiency, adding Low Power Mode to devices, and \ninstalling energy-efficient lighting and HVAC solutions \nin buildings. \n\n\u2022  We select lower-carbon alternatives, such as lower-\ncarbon concrete and steel in construction, and lower-\nemission fuels and vehicles in transportation. We use \nthese alternatives where possible, based on a number of \nfactors including cost, emissions reduction potential, and \navailability.\n\n\u2022  We\u2019re transitioning toward carbon-free electricity, \ninvesting in renewables\u2014rooftop solar installations \non our buildings, and new, utility-scale wind and solar \nprojects\u2014as well as other carbon-free electricity sources, \nsuch as nuclear. \n\n\u2022  We engage with suppliers to help reduce emissions from \n\nactivities beyond our direct operations. We encourage \nthem to set credible decarbonization goals, publicly share \nprogress, and implement carbon reduction strategies \nthroughout their operations and supply chains \u2014and \nwe are providing support to help our supply chain \ntake\u00a0action.1 \n\nIn addition to decarbonizing our own business, we are helping \ndrive progress across industries. To do this, we focus on \nthree\u00a0accelerators:  \n\n\u2022  We invest in breakthrough technology by adopting \n\nready-to-scale solutions, as well as evaluating and \ninvesting in emerging technologies that can help address \nemissions from hard-to-abate sectors including aviation, \nshipping, and building construction. Through direct \nfunding, we aim to advance our own progress toward \nnet-zero carbon emissions and help accelerate the \nwidespread adoption of new technologies by making \nthem more affordable and accessible. \n\n\u2022  We support policies that drive decarbonization. \nAmazon works with policymakers, governments, \nnongovernmental organizations (NGOs), industry \nassociations, coalitions, and other partners on numerous \n\nregulatory and policy issues. We seek to advance and \nincentivize decarbonization by supporting policies \nthat scale lower-emission fuels, drive lower-emission \nvehicle deployment and infrastructure, advance the \ndeployment of carbon-free energy, modernize the grid, \nand accelerate investments in clean technologies.\n\n\u2022  We catalyze industry action. Through The Climate \n\nPledge, Amazon brings together companies from \naround the world to drive collective action, cross-\n\nsector collaboration, and engagement in initiatives that \nencourage industry action toward decarbonization.\n\nIn parallel to reducing and avoiding emissions throughout \nour business, we are also investing in carbon neutralization \nthrough additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and \nsocially beneficial offsets. As part of this effort, we are \nengaging in science-led collaborations to build credible \nneutralization initiatives that can be deployed at scale in \nthe\u00a0future. \n\nWatch \n\n how we embed sustainability initiatives throughout all aspects of our business.\n\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue ChainWaterWaste and CircularityPackagingCarbon-Free EnergyCarbon\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n11\n\nOur Progress\n\nAmazon\u2019s Carbon Footprint\nIn 2023, our absolute carbon emissions decreased by 3%.2  \nThis overall decrease was driven by an 11% reduction in \nemissions from electricity (Scope 2) and a 5% decrease in \nindirect and supply chain emissions (Scope 3). We had a 7% \nincrease in emissions from our direct operations (Scope 1),  \nprimarily from the use of transportation fuels. Our carbon \nintensity decreased for the fifth consecutive year, down 13% \nfrom 2022 to 2023.3 This metric demonstrates how we are \nworking to decouple emissions growth from business growth. \n\nEvery year, we aim to serve our customers better, more \nquickly, and with fewer emissions, but we know our progress \nmay not be linear as our business continues to grow. In 2023, \nwe invested in carbon abatement projects across Amazon. \nWe continue to invent, think long term, and place big bets \nto accelerate decarbonization efforts year over year. In \naddition to our direct investment and work to decarbonize \nour business, we also worked with organizations throughout \nour supply chain and broader industry to reduce and avoid \nemissions and create solutions to help decarbonize our \nvalue chain. Annually, we also improve our science and \ndata-driven approach to track and measure decarbonization \nacross\u00a0Amazon.\n\nScope 1: Direct Emissions and Operations\n\nAmazon\u2019s Scope 1 emissions are primarily generated from \nthe fuel used by our transportation and logistics fleet to \ndeliver packages to customers. In 2023, our Scope 1 emissions \nincreased 7% compared to 2022 and represented 21% of our \ntotal carbon footprint. This change was due to an increase \nin the number of packages delivered by Amazon Logistics \nversus third-party transportation providers, as well as overall \nbusiness growth.  \n\nAmazon\u2019s Carbon Footprint\n\nCarbon Intensity\nCarbon Intensity (grams of CO2e per $ of gross merchandise sales)\nEmissions Category (MMT CO2e)\n\nEmissions from Direct Operations (Scope 1)\n\nFossil fuels\nRefrigerants\n\nEmissions from Purchased Electricity (Scope 2)*\n\nEmissions from Indirect Sources (Scope 3)*\n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n Corporate purchases and Amazon-branded product emissions (e.g., operating expenses, business travel, and  \nAmazon-branded product manufacturing, use phase, and end-of-life)\n Capital goods (e.g., building construction, servers and other hardware, equipment, vehicles)\n Other indirect emissions (e.g., third-party transportation, packaging, upstream energy-related)\n Lifecycle emissions from customer trips to Amazon\u2019s physical\u00a0stores\n\nAmazon\u2019s Carbon Footprint\n\nGreenhouse Gas Protocol Aligned Scope 3 Categories\n\n2022 Carbon Footprint \nrecalculated in accordance with \nupdated Carbon Methodology.\n\n2019\n122.8\n\n2020\n102.7\n\n2021\n100.8\n\n2022\n93.0\n\n2023\n80.8\n\nYoY%\n-13%\n\n5.76\n5.57\n0.19\n5.50\n39.91\n\n9.62\n9.37\n0.25\n5.27\n45.75\n\n12.11\n11.89\n0.22\n4.07\n55.36\n\n13.32\n12.96\n0.36\n3.14\n54.28\n\n14.27\n14.00\n0.27\n2.79\n51.76\n\n15.41\n\n16.70\n\n19.09\n\n19.72\n\n19.11\n\n8.01\n12.44\n4.05\n\n10.52\n15.77\n2.77\n\n15.37\n18.00\n2.91\n\n10.25\n20.90\n3.41\n\n8.95\n20.07\n3.63\n\n51.17\n\n60.64\n\n71.54\n\n70.74\n\n68.82\n\n7%\n8%\n-25%\n-11%\n-5%\n\n-3%\n\n-13%\n-4%\n7%\n\n-3%\n\nPurchased Goods and Services (Amazon corporate purchases made for Amazon\u2019s operations and services, Amazon-branded products)\nCapital Goods\nFuel- and Energy-Related Activities \nUpstream Transportation and Distribution \nBusiness Travel\nEmployee Commuting \nDownstream Transportation and Distribution \nUse of Sold Products (Amazon Devices)\nEnd-of-Life Treatment of Sold Products (Amazon Devices)\n\n2022\n20.60\n10.25\n4.76\n10.65\n0.61\n2.78\n3.41\n1.18\n0.04\n\n2023\n19.86\n8.95\n4.97\n9.30\n0.63\n2.88\n3.63\n1.50\n0.04\n\nLearn more about what\u2019s included in Amazon\u2019s carbon footprint in\u00a0our Carbon Methodology\u00a0\n\n* Scope 2 and 3 carbon emissions are calculated using a market-based method.\n\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue ChainWaterWaste and CircularityPackagingCarbon-Free EnergyCarbon\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n12\n\nIn 2023, our net sales grew 12% and more than two-thirds of \nAmazon packages were delivered via Amazon\u2019s own logistics \nnetwork. We decreased emissions per package through \noperational efficiencies, such as improving truck fill rates \n(the\u00a0percentage of truck volume that is utilized), shipping \nproducts in their own packaging without additional Amazon \npackaging, and using artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize \npackaging types. For example, Amazon data scientists trained \nan AI model to understand a variety of product attributes, \nincluding an item\u2019s shape and durability, and to analyze \ncustomer feedback on how different packaging options have \nperformed. The model is constantly learning and has helped \nreduce our use of packaging material since it launched \nin\u00a02019. \n\nWe strive to keep our packaging lightweight and minimal, \nwhile ensuring products reach customers without damage. \nLighter, more flexible, and right-sized packaging helps reduce \ndelivery emissions per package by using less material and \ntaking up less space in delivery vehicles. Since 2015, we have \nreduced the average per-shipment packaging weight by 43% \nand avoided more than 3\u00a0million metric tons of packaging, \nincluding more than 446,000 metric tons in 2023 alone.4 \nGlobally, we shipped 12% of products in their own packaging \nin 2023. This provides a better customer experience by \nminimizing the packaging materials used for delivery, \nand avoids incremental carbon emissions associated with \nadditional materials and weight. \n\nLearn more about how we\u2019re improving packaging \n\nAs the number of products we deliver has continued to \nincrease, we aim to keep improving the efficiency of the \nroutes our trucks drive. For example, to get packages to \ncustomers faster and with fewer emissions, we reorganized \n\nour U.S. transportation network from one national network \nto eight\u00a0strategic regions in 2023. Regionalization helped \nus avoid driving nearly 16 million miles last year. We also \nprioritized shipping products by lower-carbon train and sea \nroutes\u2014instead of trucking\u2014for middle mile deliveries in \nEurope. We are excited to invest in technologies today that \nwill help reduce our footprint in the future, such as scaling \nup our use of electric vehicles (EVs) and other lower-carbon \nvehicles to decrease our Scope\u00a01 emissions.\n\nScope 2: Indirect Emissions from \nPurchased\u00a0Electricity\n\nOur Scope 2 emissions are from electricity used to power \nAmazon\u2019s buildings, including data centers, office buildings, \nfulfillment centers, and grocery stores, and to charge EVs \nat our facilities. In 2023, our Scope 2 emissions decreased \nby 11% compared to 2022 and represented 4% of our total \ncarbon footprint. This decrease resulted from our increased \nuse of electricity from renewable sources, such as wind \nand onsite solar, as well as from purchasing additional \nenvironmental attributes (such as renewable energy credits) \nto signal our support for renewable energy in the grids where \nwe operate, in line with the expected generation of the \nprojects we have contracted.\n\nIn 2023, we are proud to have achieved our goal to match \n100% of the electricity consumed by our global operations \nwith renewable energy\u2014seven years ahead of our original \n2030 goal. This achievement was driven by scaling up our \nportfolio of renewable energy projects. Our journey has \nincluded enabling major solar, wind, and battery storage \nprojects around the world, including the first wind farm \nin Mississippi, and becoming the first corporate purchaser \nto invest in renewable energy projects in countries such as \n\nIndonesia, Poland, and South Africa. At the end of 2023, \nAmazon had invested in 513 global renewable energy \nprojects, including 243 utility-scale wind and solar projects, \nand 270\u00a0solar rooftops at our facilities and stores around \nthe world. In 2023 alone, 42 new utility-scale wind and \nsolar projects and 50 new on-site solar energy systems \nbecame operational. Collectively, our portfolio represents \n28 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity, an increase \nfrom 20 GW in 2022. This portfolio provides carbon-free \nelectricity to our operations, as well as delivers new carbon-\nfree electricity to the grids in communities where we operate. \nWith this scale, we have been named the world\u2019s largest \ncorporate purchaser of renewable energy for the fourth year \nin a row.5 \n\nTwo of the most important ways we lower electricity-\nrelated carbon emissions are by improving energy efficiency \nand transitioning to carbon-free energy. To date, we have \nfocused on scaling renewable energy; going forward, the \nnature of our business requires us to leverage additional \ncarbon-free energy options\u2014such as nuclear\u2014to support \nour continued growth and enable us to develop and deploy \nnew technologies such as AI. We are also focused on creating \nnew chips that are increasingly energy-efficient, such as \nAWS Graviton4, the most powerful and energy-efficient \nchip AWS has built. Graviton4 is more energy efficient than \nGraviton3 processors while providing up to 30% better \ncomputing performance, 50% more cores, and 75% more \nmemory bandwidth than Graviton3 processors. By scaling \ncarbon-free energy, we aim to make Amazon a more resilient \nand sustainable business, drive a global transition to cleaner \nenergy, and achieve our commitment to The Climate Pledge \nto reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.\n\nLearn more about our transition to carbon-free energy \n\nAmazon\u2019s Carbon Footprint \n(MMT CO2e*)\n\n Scope 1\n\n Scope 2\u2020\n\n Scope 3\u2020\n\nCarbon intensity (g CO\u2082e/$GMS\u2021) \n\n122.8\n\n51.17\n\n5.76\n\n5.50\n\n71.54\n\n100.8\n\n12.11\n\n4.07\n\n70.74\n\n93.0\n\n13.32\n\n3.14\n\n68.82\n\n80.8\n\n14.27\n\n2.79\n\n102.7\n\n60.64\n\n9.62\n\n5.27\n\n55.36\n\n54.28\n\n51.76\n\n45.75\n\n39.91\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\u00a7\n\n2023\u00a7\n\n* Million metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent.\n\u2020 Scope 2 and 3 carbon emissions are calculated using a market-based method.\n\u2021 Grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per dollar of gross merchandise sales.\n\u00a7 We updated our Carbon Methodology used for our 2022 and 2023 carbon footprint.\n\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue ChainWaterWaste and CircularityPackagingCarbon-Free EnergyCarbon\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n13\n\nScope 3: Indirect Emissions from Other Sources\n\nScope 3 emissions include emissions from activities that \ntake place beyond our direct operations, including building \nconstruction, third-party transportation, and the production \nof Amazon-branded products and the materials and \ncomponents used in those products. In 2023, our Scope 3 \nemissions decreased by 5% from 2022 and represented 75% \nof our total carbon footprint. This decrease resulted from \nreductions related to building construction, leased buildings \nand equipment, and third-party transportation, as more \ngoods were shipped by Amazon\u2019s own logistics providers \nversus third-party providers than in 2022.\n\nBuilding construction is a significant driver of carbon \nemissions in many supply chains due to the associated \nembodied carbon that is emitted. Embodied carbon includes \nany carbon emissions created during the manufacturing \nof building materials, the transport of those materials to \nthe job site, and the construction practices used. Embodied \ncarbon is counted in a company\u2019s carbon footprint the year \nthe building is completed and operational. We aim to reduce \nembodied carbon in building construction by using lower-\nemission concrete, lower-emission steel, and mass timber. In \n2023, 29 Amazon building projects were constructed with \nlower-carbon concrete and steel, and collectively reduced \nembodied carbon by 79,500 metric tons of CO2e, equivalent \nto the emissions generated by 17,200 cars driven for a year.\n\nBecause Scope 3 emissions are beyond our direct operational \ncontrol, the efforts our suppliers take to reduce their \nemissions help us progress toward our ambition to achieve \nnet-zero carbon emissions by 2040. We will prioritize working \nwith suppliers who are also committed to decarbonization \nand reaching net-zero carbon emissions. We have identified \na list of the highest-emitting suppliers directly supporting \nour operations, and expect those suppliers, who collectively \ncontribute more than 50% of emissions globally to Amazon\u2019s \nScope 3 footprint, to provide a plan for how they will \ndecarbonize their operations and demonstrate real progress \nover time. We will prioritize our business toward those \n\nwho provide their plans and results on their path to net-\nzero carbon emissions. We are already working with many \nof these suppliers, and will continue our engagement and \nshare learnings. In addition, we also launched our \u201cAmazon \nSustainability Exchange\u201d\u2014a free, publicly available website \nthat democratizes our guidelines, playbooks, science \nmodels, and other resources to help other companies make \nmeaningful progress toward net-zero carbon emissions.\n\nLearn more about how we\u2019re engaging suppliers to \ndecarbonize our supply chain \n\nPath to 2040\n\nWe know the path to net-zero carbon by 2040 will be \nchallenging, but we are making investments, creating new \nways of working, and inventing new solutions to help us \ndecarbonize now and in the future. At Amazon, we think long \nterm, and we\u2019re committed to working collectively with our \nsupply chain and industry partners to create and scale new \ndecarbonization solutions.\n\nWe\u2019re proud of the work we do, not just within our own \noperations but across the many industries of which we are a \npart. At the end of 2023, The Climate Pledge included 473 \nsignatories focused on achieving net-zero carbon emissions \nby 2040. Signatories are working together more than ever \nbefore, with five new joint action projects launched in \n2023. We are also investing in companies that are building \nbreakthrough technologies and other solutions that could, \nlonger-term, lower the overall cost of decarbonization, even \nin hard-to-abate sectors. One way we do this is through The \nClimate Pledge Fund, Amazon\u2019s $2 billion venture investment \nprogram, which supports the advancement of sustainability-\nfocused technologies and services that will enable us to meet \nour net-zero carbon emissions goal.\n\nWe will continue to innovate, collaborate, and do the work \nneeded to deliver the best for our customers, progress \ntoward net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, and most \nimportantly, contribute to a healthier planet.\n\nKey Milestones on Our Net-Zero Carbon Journey\n\n100% of the electricity consumed by \nour global operations was matched \nwith renewable energy\u2014seven years \nahead of our original 2030 goal\n\n10,000 electric vehicles in our \nIndia delivery fleet by 2025\n\nAmazon co-founded \nThe Climate Pledge \nwith Global Optimism \nand was the first \ncompany to sign on\n\nRight Now Climate Fund\nA $100 million fund for \nnature-based solutions to \nrestore and conserve forests, \nwetlands, and grasslands \naround the world\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\n2030\n\n500+ signatories of The Climate Pledge\n\nThe Climate Pledge Fund\nA $2 billion venture investment \nprogram supporting the \nadvancement of sustainable \ntechnologies and services that \nenable Amazon to meet our \nnet-zero carbon emissions goal\n\nIn 2022, The Climate \nPledge Fund committed at \nleast $50 million to invest \nin female-founded and \nfemale-led climate \ntechnology companies\n\nAWS committed to being \nwater positive by 2030, \nreturning more water to \nthe communities where \nAWS operates than is \nused in direct operations\n\nNet-Zero\nCarbon\nEmissions\n\n2040\n\nAt least 100,000 electric delivery \nvans on the road by 2030, from \nRivian and other manufacturers\n\nInvest in wind and solar farm capacity equal \nto the energy use of all active Echo, Fire TV, \nand Ring devices worldwide by 2025\n\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue ChainWaterWaste and CircularityPackagingCarbon-Free EnergyCarbon\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n14\n\nDelivery and Logistics\nWe rely on a complex transportation network to get products \nfrom manufacturers and sellers to customers around \nthe globe.\u00a0Our logistics network uses different modes of \ntransportation, including ships, planes, freight trains, trucks, \nvans, and bikes, across three transportation legs: \n\n\u2022  First mile\u00a0is the first transportation leg, used for \ntransporting shipments from the manufacturer or \nsupplier to an Amazon facility. First mile includes \nmaritime and airfreight shipping, as well as movement \nby truck and rail. \n\n\u2022  Middle mile is the intermediate transportation leg, \n\nwhere we move shipments between Amazon facilities. It \nis also called long-distance transportation. Middle mile \nincludes commercial trucking, aviation, maritime, and \nintermodal sea and rail.\u00a0\n\n\u2022  Last mile is the final transportation leg that delivers \n\npackages from Amazon\u00a0to customers. It includes vans, \ntrucks, and micromobility solutions such as e-cargo bikes \nand on-foot delivery.\n\nWe have adopted a multi-pronged strategy to transport \nproducts safely, quickly, efficiently, and more sustainably.  \nWe are decarbonizing first, middle, and last mile \ntransportation by: \n\n\u2022  Increasing routing and fleet efficiency. In 2023, \nwe restructured our U.S. fulfillment operations by \nreorganizing our national network of fulfillment centers, \nintermediate sort centers, last mile delivery hubs, and \ntransportation fleet into eight regions. This shift ensures \nwe\u2019re producing, packaging, and shipping from facilities \nthat are closer to the communities we serve, which \nreduces the complexity of our shipping network and the \nmiles traveled to get to our customers\u2014helping drive \ndown both carbon emissions and shipping costs. This \nnew model optimizes delivery speed, reduces emissions, \nand provides the breadth of selection that customers \nexpect. In the fourth quarter of 2023 alone, we shipped \nnearly 544\u00a0million more items from in-region fulfillment \n\ncenters than we did during the same period of 2022. \nShipping from in-region fulfillment centers to our \ndelivery stations also reduces the number of stops per \npackage\u2014avoiding nearly 16 million miles driven in \n2023\u2014and decreases our reliance on air transportation.\n\u2022  Increasing packaging and packing efficiency. We focus \n\non increasing pack and fill rates\u2014the percentage of \npackage volume that is utilized\u2014and truck fill rates\u2014\nthe percentage of truck volume that is utilized\u2014to fit \nmore products into shipping vehicles. This reduces the \nnumber of trucks we need\u2014and the carbon emissions \nassociated with them\u2014to deliver our products.\n\n\u2022  Scaling use of EVs and micromobility \n\nsolutions.\u00a0Sending demand signals and scaling \navailability of alternative transportation solutions is \ncritical to accelerating industry progress. This includes \ncharging infrastructure, electric trucks, electric delivery \nvehicles, e-cargo bikes, e-mopeds, and on-foot deliveries \nfrom micromobility hubs.\n\n\u2022  Increasing use of alternative-fuel vehicles and low-\n\ncarbon fuels. The early adoption of lower-carbon fuels \nis another way we are working to minimize the carbon \nfootprint of our transportation and logistics network, \nas well as a critical component to building out the \nalternative fuels market. We are investing in lower-\ncarbon fuels today to encourage industry development \nand demand, with the goal of ultimately making them \nmore accessible and affordable for everyone. \n\n\u2022  Partnering on initiatives to decarbonize \n\ntransportation. We participate in multi-stakeholder \ninitiatives to shift the industry toward lower-carbon \nsolutions at scale, such as EVs, charging infrastructure, \nand lower-carbon fuels.\n\n\u2022  Creating lower-carbon shipping options for \n\ncustomers. We focus on consolidating shipments to \nreduce deliveries, as well as reducing packaging by \nshipping more items in each box and more items in their \noriginal\u00a0packaging. \n\nFirst Mile \n\nFirst mile transportation is the beginning of a product\u2019s \nshipment path from the manufacturer, wholesaler, or \ndistributor to an Amazon facility via\u00a0ship, airplane, train, or \ntruck. In many cases, first mile shipments cross international \nborders. We are focused on decarbonizing first mile \ntransportation while maintaining efficiency and reliability \nand reducing costs.\u00a0For instance, we have discovered \ninnovative ways to prioritize ocean and rail transportation to \nreduce our reliance on airfreight.\n\nOcean transportation has a lower\u00a0carbon footprint than air \ntransportation does, so we prioritize shipping our products \non ships, whenever feasible. In 2023, we transported 90%\u00a0of \n\nour imported transoceanic shipments via ocean freight and \n2% via airfreight. \n\nOcean Freight\nZero-emission fuel: Along with opting for more efficient \nshipping routes, we also prioritize lower-carbon marine \nbiofuels. In 2021, we were a founding member of the First \nMovers Coalition, a global coalition of companies leveraging \ntheir purchasing power to decarbonize the world\u2019s heavy-\nemitting sectors, such as ocean transportation. Through \nour active participation, we are supporting First Movers \nCoalition\u2019s goal to use maritime ships with zero-emission \nfuels for at least 10% of cargo shipped internationally by \n2030.

Through our \nmembership, we are supporting coZEV\u2019s goal to use maritime \nships with zero-emission fuels for 100% of ocean cargo by \n2040. \n\nBiofuel: Our investment in maritime biofuel helps to \naccelerate the shipping industry\u2019s transition to zero-emission \nfuels by demonstrating demand for lower-carbon fuel \nalternatives to bunker fuel. In 2023, we transported 10% \nof our ocean cargo via maritime ships powered by lower-\nemission biofuels and finalized a 2023\u20132024 agreement with \nMaersk through their \u201cECO Delivery\u201d ocean product offering. \nAs part of this collaboration, Amazon piloted shipping cargo \non the first methanol-powered vessel, from Singapore to \nRotterdam. As availability increases, we will continue to \nincrease the percentage of cargo we transport on these types \nof ships and leverage additional lower-carbon fuels in 2024 \nand beyond.\n\nLearn more about this landmark zero-emission voyage\u00a0\n\nIn early 2023, we co-founded the Zero Emission Maritime \nBuyers Alliance (ZEMBA) with the Aspen Institute, Patagonia, \nand Tchibo.\u00a0ZEMBA seeks to accelerate commercial \ndeployment of zero-emission shipping, enable economies \nof scale, and reduce maritime emissions. Six months after \nits launch, ZEMBA released a request for proposals for zero-\nemission shipping services to be delivered by 2025. This \nwas the first major buyer-led initiative for the transition to \nzero-emission fuels in maritime shipping\u2014one of the most \nchallenging sectors to decarbonize.\n\nLearn more about how we are improving the shorelines \nand areas surrounding the ocean routes we utilize\u00a0\n\nAirfreight\nWhile we prioritize ocean transportation, air transportation \nis an important part of our first mile logistics network, \nthough it represents only 10% of our transoceanic imports. \n\nAviation is also considered a hard-to-abate sector, which \nis why we are sourcing lower-carbon aviation fuels such \nas sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and using SAF credits to \nreduce our own airfreight emissions as well as working with \npeers on innovative industry-wide solutions. Lower-carbon \naviation fuel, such as SAF, currently represents less than \n0.1% of global aviation fuel and remains cost-prohibitive for \nmost companies. To help address these challenges, Amazon \nis a founding member of the Sustainable Aviation Buyers \nAlliance\u00a0\nSustainable Aviation Fuel certificates (SAFc) Registry\u00a0\n at the \n28th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28). \nThe SAFc Registry aims to bring more transparency to \nemissions reduction claims and accelerate SAF deployment.\n\n\u00a0(SABA) and played a critical role in launching the \n\nMiddle Mile\n\nMiddle mile transportation starts when packages arrive at an \nAmazon facility and covers the journey between fulfillment \ncenters and sort centers to delivery stations. In addition to \nenhancing routing efficiency through regionalization, we are \ndecarbonizing middle mile transportation by increasing the \nnumber of EVs on the road and at our facilities and adopting \nlower-carbon fuels. We also partner with others to create \nindustry solutions that accelerate decarbonization of this leg \nof the transportation network.\n\nMiddle Mile Efficiency \nMoving products by rail or sea\u2014instead of on the road, \nby conventional trucks\u2014reduces carbon emissions by an \naverage of nearly 50%. Europe\u2019s geographic landscape and \ninfrastructure in particular often make rail and sea the faster \nand more efficient routing options. In 2023, we increased our \nuse of rail and ocean transportation in Europe by over 50%, \ndistributing products through more than 100 rail lanes and \nmore than 300 sea routes across the continent.

Amazon and delivery service \nproviders\u00a0(DSPs) deployed more than 245\u00a0electric middle \nmile vehicles in 2023. We also have nearly 18,000 hydrogen-\npowered forklifts operating at more than 81 fulfillment \ncenters, as well as 110\u00a0electric yard hostlers\u2014vehicles \nthat move truck trailers around fulfillment centers\u2014in \nNorth\u00a0America.\n\nJaya Varma Sinha, CEO of Indian Railways, spoke at the Smbhav Summit \nin 2023. Indian Railways\u2019 partnership with Amazon India enables more \nsustainable modes of transportation and faster and more reliable delivery \nof customer packages in the region.\n\nIndian Railways are the backbone of India\u2019s transportation \nsystem thanks to the widespread network of trains that \ntransport millions of people and freight across the country \neach day. In 2019, Amazon became the first e-commerce \ncompany to leverage this vast train network\u00a0by entering into \nan operational engagement with Indian Railways to meet \nour customer promise of fast and reliable deliveries. We have \ncontinued this collaboration, increasing our use of Indian \nRailways\u2019 electric locomotives to ship packages in 2023. \nWe also partnered with eFast\u2014India\u2019s first national freight \nelectrification platform led by the government policy think \ntank\u00a0NITI Aayog\u2014to engage policymakers on policies that \ncan help decarbonize rail\u00a0freight.\n\nAmazon recognizes that the infrastructure needed to \nsupport the charging of electric heavy goods vehicles \n(eHGVs) at delivery stations and on the road is one barrier \nto scaling their use around the world. That is why we work \nwith eHGV manufacturers and other partners to improve \ncharging infrastructure and electricity grids. For instance, \nwe partner with third-party charge point operators to set \nup charging yards at locations that best serve our Amazon \nsites. In Europe, we published CHALET (Charging Locations \nfor Electric Trucks), a new, open-source tool to help private \nindustry, governments, electricity network operators, and \nlocal authorities determine where to build electric charging \npoints for eHGVs. Transportation and logistics operators \nare encouraged to input data into the tool, which CHALET \nthen uses to generate a ranked list of recommended \ncharger\u00a0locations.\n\nMiddle Mile Zero-Emission and Lower-Carbon Fuels \nIn addition to putting EVs on the road, we are exploring ways \nto decarbonize our middle mile transportation operations by \nadopting lower-carbon fuels such as hydrogen, renewable \ndiesel, and renewable natural gas (RNG).6\u00a0\n\nIn 2023, we piloted\u00a0the use of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles \n(FCVs) in Europe and Japan. These initiatives will provide us \nwith more information about the right FCV size to maximize \nperformance, determine optimal hydrogen storage and \npower management, and understand the viability of these \n\nvehicles for middle mile transportation. In 2024, we aim to \nincrease the number of FCVs deployed in our transportation \nnetwork. \n\nto enable companies to better understand and track their \nlogistics emissions on a granular operational level, from \nsupplier to final customer.\n\nAmazon began mobile fueling diesel-powered vehicles\u2014\nincluding trucks that operate short, local routes and vehicles \nthat operate within our facilities\u2014with renewable diesel \nat all California and Oregon fulfillment and sort centers in \n2023. Renewable diesel is made from waste fats, greases, \nand other oils. And in India, we are collaborating with \nlocal oil companies to develop renewable diesel and other \nalternative fuels such as compressed biogas.\u00a0\n\nTo reduce our logistics-related emissions, Amazon is also \nincreasing the availability of compressed natural gas vehicles \n(CNGs). CNGs are trucks powered by natural gas instead of \ngasoline or diesel fuel. They can reduce carbon\u00a0emissions \nby\u00a0at least 75% compared to diesel when refueled with \nRNG.\u00a0Globally, Amazon had 4,400 CNGs on the road in 2023, \nusing 30 million gallons of RNG. This growth was driven \nby the opening of seven permanent RNG fueling stations \nacross our North American logistics network in partnership \nwith Clean Energy, the largest provider of RNG for the \ntransportation industry in North America.\n\nPartnerships Accelerating Middle Mile Decarbonization \nTrucking is a challenging area to decarbonize, particularly \nconsidering the long-haul distances driven and the \nrequirements for high-power EV charging infrastructure \nacross transportation routes. Identifying and scaling \nsolutions for this important method of transportation cannot \nbe done by one company alone\u2014it requires the know-how, \nresources, and experience of collaborative partners across \nindustries and sectors.\n\nIn 2023, Amazon participated in the Smart Freight Centre \n(SFC) Exchange Network, a nonprofit organization whose \nmission is to accelerate the reduction of logistics emissions \nby fostering collaboration. As part of its work, SFC is \nincreasing transparency and accountability around logistics \nemissions. In 2023, SFC and the World Business Council \nfor Sustainable Development (WBCSD) launched guidance \n\nWe also became the first logistics provider to join the \nEVs2Scale2030 initiative with the Electric Power Research \nInstitute (EPRI). Bringing together industry and the U.S. \ngovernment, this initiative aims to increase the number of EVs \non U.S. roads\u2014from cars to heavy-duty trucks. Members are \nworking to ready the electric grid in support of accelerated \ndevelopment of EV charging infrastructure. In 2023, the \norganization released eRoadMAP, a publicly available \ninteractive map of transportation load growth across the U.S. \n\nAdditionally, in 2023, The Climate Pledge and C40 Cities (C40) \ndeveloped Laneshift, a partnership to accelerate the transition \nto zero-emission electric trucks and charging infrastructure \nacross major cities in India and Latin America.\n\nLearn more about Laneshift\u00a0\n\nLast Mile\n\nLast mile transportation refers to the final part of the \ndelivery journey. This is when products are transported from \nsort centers and delivery stations to customers via delivery \nvans, electric delivery vehicles (four-wheel, three-wheel, two-\nwheel, and e-mopeds), and micromobility solutions, including \ne-cargo bikes and\u00a0on-foot deliveries.\u00a0To help reduce\u00a0delivery-\nrelated emissions, we are investing in EVs and working to \noptimize our delivery van and package fill rates as products \nembark on the final leg of their journey.\u00a0Amazon deliveries \nare made by DSPs, who are independent contractors that \noperate their own delivery businesses.\n\nLearn more about Amazon\u2019s DSP program\u00a0\n\nLast Mile Electric Delivery Vehicles\nIncreasing the number of EVs in Amazon\u2019s\u00a0delivery fleet is an \nimportant part of our approach to\u00a0avoiding carbon emissions \nacross the last mile of our transportation network.

In dense cities, these hubs enable us to utilize non-\ntraditional delivery methods, such as e-cargo bikes and on-\nfoot deliveries, to bring packages to customers in ways that \ngenerate fewer carbon emissions. \n\nIn 2023, we delivered more than 125\u00a0million\u00a0packages via \ne-cargo bikes and on foot from micromobility hubs around \nthe world. In Europe, we doubled the number of cities in \nwhich we operate micromobility hubs from over 20 in 2022 \nto more than 40 in 2023.

We also scaled the \nAmazon Hub Delivery program\u2014which partners with small \nand medium-sized businesses to deliver packages in local \nneighborhoods\u2014to over 2,000 partners that delivered nearly \n14 million shipments in 2023, around half of which were \ndelivered on foot or bike.\n\nCustomer Shipping Options to Avoid Carbon Emissions\nWe offer our customers shipping options that help reduce \nthe carbon emissions associated with the delivery of their \nproducts. We also have programs for sellers to reduce \ndelivery emissions and decrease costs.\n\nAmazon Day Delivery\n\nOur Amazon Day shipping option allows Prime members to \nchoose a designated day of the week to receive their orders. \nBy consolidating orders into fewer packages and deliveries, \nwe are avoiding emissions by saving boxes and reducing \ntrips to individual addresses. In 2023, Amazon Day delivery \navoided the use of more than 200 million boxes (up from \nnearly 115 million in 2022) and\u00a0226,000\u00a0metric tons of CO2e. \n\nShips in Product Packaging\n\nIn the U.S., Manhattan, New York, is an ideal place to deploy \nmicromobility delivery operations due to its high population \n\nOur Ships in Product Packaging program, formerly called \nShips in Own Container, tests and certifies products that can \n\nship safely in just their original manufacturers\u2019 packaging\u2014\nwithout an additional Amazon box, envelope, or bag. This \nminimizes the packaging materials used for delivery and \nallows packages to take up less space in delivery vehicles, \nincreasing our truck fill rate.\n\nAmazon recently launched an initiative in the U.S. to \nincrease the number of items tested for qualification in \nthe Ships in Product Packaging program by extending the \nprogram to Fulfillment by Amazon sellers\u00a0\n. The program \nbenefits these sellers by enabling them to provide a better \ncustomer experience\u00a0while reducing the costs associated with \nfulfillment.\n\nLearn more about how we are reducing our\u00a0packaging \nfootprint\u00a0\n\nBuilding Construction and \nOperations \nOur building portfolio comprises thousands of owned \nand leased facilities in more than 60 countries, including \noperations buildings, grocery stores, corporate offices, \nand data centers\u00a0 \u2009. The construction, operation, and \ndecommissioning of these buildings accounted for one \nfifth of Amazon\u2019s total carbon emissions in 2023, which \nis why we\u2019re committed to implementing and scaling \ndecarbonization solutions and processes to reduce the \nfootprint of this sector of our business.\n\nCarbon emissions connected to our buildings\u00a0fall into two \ncategories: embodied emissions and operational emissions. \nEmbodied emissions in the buildings sector are generated \nfrom the manufacture, transportation, installation, \nmaintenance, and disposal of building materials. Operational \nemissions refer to resources consumed by day-to-day \nprocesses needed to run our business, including computing, \nlighting, heating, cooling, ventilation, refrigeration systems, \nand operating other equipment. \n\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue ChainWaterWaste and CircularityPackagingCarbon-Free EnergyCarbon\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n18\n\nGlobally, our work to reduce carbon emissions related to our \nbuildings focuses on: \n\n\u2022  Implementing foundational efficiency\u00a0initiatives:\u00a0We \nare instituting and improving data collection practices \nto better track our performance and inform our efforts \nto improve efficiency and reduce energy use and carbon \nemissions across our buildings portfolio. \n\n\u2022  Scaling renewable energy and lower-carbon \n\napproaches to heating and cooling: We use on-site \nrenewables, such as rooftop solar installations on \nbuildings we operate, as well as renewable energy from \nthe grid to power our buildings.

This work starts with \ncollecting robust, accurate, timely, and meaningful data to \nidentify opportunities for improvement.\n\nOur Enterprise Building Management System (EBMS) is one \nof the tools we use to measure and track energy efficiency \nat our existing sites. This standardized platform manages \nfacility energy use and controls various building systems to \nminimize associated carbon emissions. Many of our buildings \nhave thousands of sensors to monitor water use, air flow, \ntemperature, and other environmental variables, which help \n\nus further improve and optimize our designs. By the end \nof 2023, our EBMS was active in more than\u00a01,200\u00a0facilities \nglobally, a 14% increase from 2022. \n\nWe increase energy efficiency across our building operations \nthrough lighting and EBMS retrofits as well as rooftop \nheating, ventilation, and air conditioning unit replacements. \nLighting retrofits alone have saved 1.23\u00a0billion\u00a0megawatt-\nhours (MWh) of energy and avoided more than 873,000 \nmetric tons of CO2e from 2017 to 2023. These upgrades have \nincluded converting all non-LED lamps to high-efficiency LED \nfixtures with dimming controls.\n\nValidating Our Progress\nAs teams across Amazon progress toward the \ndecarbonization of our buildings, we\u2019ve begun to \nvalidate our efforts using the International Living Future \nInstitute\u2019s Zero Carbon Certification (ZCC). This third-party \ncertification program validates improvements to our building \ndecarbonization efforts and provides clear accountability \nfor our internal teams and external building partners. This \nrigorous, carbon-centric program requires us to provide \nactual measured\u2014not predicted\u2014performance over one \nyear of building occupancy to assess credible carbon emission \nreductions. This means that we are just now receiving \ncertifications for the first pilot projects we submitted for \nevaluation.\n\nAmazon achieved two full certifications for building projects \nin 2023: an Amazon Fresh store in Seattle, Washington\u2014\nwhich was the world\u2019s first building of its type to achieve \nthe certification\u2014and a Same Day delivery station in \nSacramento, California\u2014the first-ever North American \nlogistics building to be certified. We are working to scale \nalignment with this certification program throughout our \ncompany, with dozens of projects across our global buildings \nportfolio currently using ZCC standards to measure and \nvalidate our decarbonization efforts.\n\nDesign elements at HQ2 incorporate native flora and fauna \nand use earth tones and natural materials, such as wood and \nstone, to create a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nSustainability at Our Second Headquarters \n\nWe want our corporate offices to be both inspiring \nplaces to work and models of what is possible when it \ncomes to sustainable design and construction.\n\nWe built our second headquarters (HQ2) in Arlington, \nVirginia, with sustainability in mind. Opened in May \n2023, HQ2 runs on 100% renewable electricity \nand achieves energy savings of 24% relative to a \ncomparable Leadership in Energy and Environmental \nDesign (LEED) baseline. In March 2024, it became the \nlargest project (by building square footage) in the U.S. \nto receive LEED v4 Platinum certification.\n\nUsing an advanced lower-carbon concrete mix design \nthat included CarbonCure, which we invested in through \nThe Climate Pledge Fund  \u2009, we achieved a 20% \nreduction in HQ2\u2019s concrete structure carbon footprint \ncompared to the industry baseline.8 This avoided \n14,700 metric tons of CO2e, which is the equivalent of \ntaking 3,500 cars off the road in the U.S. for an entire \nyear. More than 40 Amazon sites globally now use this \nsame CarbonCure technology.\n\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue ChainWaterWaste and CircularityPackagingCarbon-Free EnergyCarbon\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n19\n\nScaling Renewable Energy and Lower-Carbon \nApproaches to Heating and Cooling\n\nWe are working to reduce the emissions associated with \noperating our buildings by using renewable energy and other \nlower-carbon alternatives. \n\nScaling Renewable Energy\nAt the end of 2023, Amazon had 270 rooftop solar projects \nat our facilities around the globe. We brought 50 new on-site \nsolar energy systems online in 2023, for a total capacity of \n58 MW. These on-site solar energy systems are estimated to \ngenerate 123,000 MWh annually\u2014enough energy to power \nover 33,600 European homes\u2014and avoid the equivalent of \nroughly 47,400 metric tons of CO2e each year compared to \nnonrenewable electricity sources.\n\nLearn more about how we are scaling carbon-free energy\u00a0\n\nLower-Emission Refrigerants\u00a0\nRefrigerants are cooling agents used in air conditioners, heat \npumps, refrigerators, and freezers. Refrigerants with high \nGWP\u2014such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)\u2014contribute to \nclimate change by trapping more heat in the atmosphere \nthan\u00a0CO2. That\u2019s why Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market \nuse low-GWP refrigerants, such as CO2 refrigerants, to help \ngrocery stores reduce emissions.\n\nBy the end of 2023, 46 Whole Foods Market stores were \nusing low-GWP refrigeration systems. Whole Foods Market \nhas also committed to using only low-GWP refrigeration \nsystems in new stores in North America starting in 2025. \nTogether, Amazon and Whole Foods Market donated\u00a0to the \nNorth American Sustainable Refrigeration Council in 2023 to \naccelerate the council\u2019s efforts to train the next generation of \nskilled technicians needed to install and maintain sustainable \nrefrigeration systems.\n\nEnergy Efficiency and Alternative Fuels in AWS \nData\u00a0Centers\nAWS takes a holistic approach to minimizing energy and \nwater consumption in its operations, including in data \n\ncenters. For example, AWS is increasing the use of free-\nair cooling systems that cool servers with outside air. This \navoids the need for energy-intensive compressor-based \ncooling systems throughout much of the year. Even during \npeak summer temperatures, data centers can utilize direct \nevaporative cooling, a process that uses water to cool the air \nand remove heat from servers. \n\nIn 2023, AWS started transitioning to hydrotreated vegetable \noil (HVO) to power backup generators at its data centers \nin the U.S. and Europe. HVO is a type of renewable diesel \nmade from waste cooking oil or vegetable, plant, and residue \noils. AWS sites in Ireland, Sweden, and Oregon were among \nthe first to make the switch to HVO. Renewable diesel is \nreadily available in regions such as the U.S. West and parts \nof Europe, but sourcing in areas such as the U.S. East and \nMidwest remains a challenge due to the lack of distribution \nterminals and established supply chains for this type of \nfuel. In response, fuel distributors are beginning to invest in \nrenewable diesel terminals along the U.S. East Coast, and \nAWS plans to explore these sourcing opportunities once they \nare available.\n\nCreating Industry Solutions to Reduce \nEmbodied\u00a0Carbon\n\nDecarbonizing the buildings sector is a challenge no one \ncompany or organization can solve alone. We can, however, \naccelerate progress by engaging with industry partners \nto develop and scale innovations that reduce carbon \nemissions associated with the construction, operation, and \ndecommissioning of buildings across sectors and markets.\n\nUsing Lower-Carbon Materials\nWe are working to reduce embodied carbon in our \ninfrastructure by increasing the use of lower-carbon \nmaterials in Amazon buildings, such as lower-carbon steel, \nlower-carbon concrete, and mass timber, a lower-carbon \nstructural wood product that can replace concrete and steel \nin building construction.\n\nIn 2023, 29 Amazon building projects were constructed \nwith lower-carbon concrete and steel, collectively reducing \nembodied carbon by over 79,000 metric tons of CO2e. \nAmazon used mass timber when building HQ2 and, in 2023, \nprogressed in the design and construction of three new \nbuildings that will use mass timber structural elements.\n\nIn 2023, AWS built 36 data centers with lower-carbon \nconcrete, up from 16 in 2022. AWS also tested a low-carbon, \nperformance-based ASTM C1157 Hydraulic Cement by \nOzinga, a concrete, bulk materials, and logistics solutions \nsupplier, which achieved a 64% reduction in embodied \ncarbon compared to the industry average. In January 2024, \nAWS updated its design standards to require the use of \nconcrete with 35% less embodied carbon than the industry \naverage in new data centers around the world.\n\nWe can also mitigate a building\u2019s carbon footprint by using \nhigher-strength structural steel, which is made by cooling \nthe metal quickly during manufacturing. The manufacturing \nprocess of lower-carbon steel gives it a higher strength-\nto-weight ratio, which means that less material\u2014and as a \nresult, less embodied carbon\u2014is used to perform the same \nfunction. By incorporating higher-strength steel into its data \ncenter structural designs, AWS has reduced steel content by \n70 tons for each two-story data center and 137 tons for each \nthree-story data center, decreasing emissions by 63 and 124 \nmetric tons of CO2e, respectively. In 2023, AWS built 31 data \ncenters with lower-carbon steel, up from 10 in 2022.  \n\nUsing lower-carbon steel and concrete enabled AWS to avoid \nover 46,700 metric tons of CO2e in 2023\u2014equivalent to the \ncarbon emissions generated from driving over 11,100 cars in \nthe U.S. for one year. We will continue working with suppliers \nto achieve even greater carbon savings in future Amazon \nbuildings by increasing the use of lower-carbon materials in \ntheir construction.\n\nPartnering to Develop Industry Standards for Measuring \nEmbodied Carbon\nEmbodied carbon is our largest source of building-related \ncarbon emissions\u00a0and something we address in our  \nbuilding design and construction strategies. Since 2022, we \n\n\u00a0to track and report the embodied carbon of our \n\nhave been using the Embodied Carbon in Construction  \nCalculator\u00a0\nbuilding construction materials. This open-access industry \ntool allows us to benchmark, assess, and reduce embodied \ncarbon. It focuses on\u00a0emissions from the construction \nmaterials supply chain, using a database of digital, third-\nparty-verified Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs). \nEPDs are a way for manufacturers to take comprehensive, \nthird-party-verified life cycle assessments (LCAs) and turn \nthem into standardized labels for their products. We use this \ndata to select lower-carbon construction materials.\n\nAmazon asks our building contractors, including \narchitectural, design, and construction companies, to \nuse this tool as part of our building delivery process. \nIn 2023, this requirement increased the use of the tool \nby\u00a0231 building contractors across 47 companies and 26 \ncountries. This uptake has helped scale and deploy expertise \nin how to reduce embodied carbon across the broader \nbuilding\u00a0industry.\n\n\u2006, seeks to help professionals \n\nIn 2023, we worked with the UK Chartered Institution of \nBuilding Services Engineers (CIBSE) and our supply chain \npartners to create public-facing embodied carbon baselining \nguidance for the logistics sector. This guidance, called \nTechnical Memorandum 65.3\u00a0\nacross Europe assess and understand the embodied \ncarbon of material handling and mechanical, electrical, \nand plumbing equipment. Using data that is new to the \nindustry, Technical Memorandum 65.3 will enable Amazon, \nour supply chain partners, and our peers to establish a \nbaseline understanding of carbon emissions from industrial \nequipment, paving the way to ultimately identifying \nadditional carbon reduction opportunities.\nServers and Hardware\nAs the world\u2019s most comprehensive and broadly adopted \ncloud provider, AWS is committed to building a lower-carbon \nbusiness for its customers and the planet. AWS designs \nits data centers\u2014including servers and hardware\u2014for \nefficiency, resiliency, and a lower carbon footprint. \n\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue ChainWaterWaste and CircularityPackagingCarbon-Free EnergyCarbon\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n20\n\nAWS\u2019s scale allows for higher resource utilization and energy \nefficiency than the typical\u00a0on-premises data center. From the \ninfrastructure that powers its servers to the techniques that \nkeep them cool, efficiency is a primary goal for every part of \nthe AWS Global Cloud Infrastructure. \n\nThe AWS Global Cloud Infrastructure is built on AWS\u2019s own \ncustom hardware and optimized for workloads run by AWS \ncustomers. Research shows that in North America, AWS can \nlower its customers\u2019 workload carbon footprints by up to \n96% compared to on-premises computing workloads when \nthe electricity AWS uses is matched with 100% renewable \nenergy\u2014a goal that Amazon, including AWS, achieved in 2023.\n\nAWS is reducing emissions related to server use and \nnetworking equipment by increasing server lifespan. This \nincludes refining software to run more efficiently, which \nlowers stress on hardware and extends the amount of time \nit can be used. In February 2024, AWS announced that the \naverage expected life of its servers had improved from five \nto six years. To support these efforts, AWS has a robust \nmaintenance and repair program in place that is designed \nto increase component reuse and further reduce carbon \nemissions and waste across its supply chain.\n\nLearn more about how AWS is advancing circular \neconomy\u00a0principles\u00a0\n\nEnhancing Chip Efficiency\n\nOne of the most visible ways AWS is innovating for power \nefficiency is through its investment in purpose-built chips. \nA chip is a tiny wafer of semiconducting material with \nan embedded electronic circuit. It contains millions of \nmicroscopic electronic components called transistors that \ntransmit data signals. Chips today are high-performance \nprocessors that power all types of advanced analytics, \ngraphics, and machine learning applications. \n\nIn 2023, AWS launched Inferentia2, the second generation \nof its Inferentia chip, developed to deliver the highest \n\nperformance at the lowest cost per watt. Inferentia2 is up \nto 50% more energy-efficient\u00a0and can reduce costs by up \nto 40% against comparable Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \n(EC2) instances.\n\nMeanwhile, AWS Graviton4 is the\u00a0latest generation of chips \ndesigned by AWS and the most powerful and energy-\nefficient chip AWS has built as of 2023. Graviton4 provides \nup to 30% better computing performance, 50% more \ncores, and 75% more memory bandwidth\u00a0than Graviton3 \nprocessors while being more energy efficient.\n\nPartnering to Reduce Carbon Emissions in the \nSemiconductor Industry\n\nAWS knows that by collaborating across the entire \nsemiconductor industry, it can drive carbon emission \nreductions at a scale greater than what is possible on its own. \nTo that end, AWS is partnering with its suppliers to decrease \ntheir operational emissions and engage their own upstream \nsupply chains to do the same. In 2023, AWS joined the \nSemiconductor Climate Consortium (SCC), an organization \nfocused on reducing carbon emissions across the global \nsemiconductor supply chain. The SCC collaboration \naccelerates decarbonization for member company operations \nand enables new solutions and approaches for adoption.\n\nProducts and Devices\u00a0\nAmazon Private Brands\n\nTwo of our private brands, Amazon Essentials and \nAmazon Basics, make products across many categories, \nincluding clothing, bedroom furniture and mattresses, \nkitchen appliances and cookware, toys, pet essentials, and \nworkout gear. Amazon works with suppliers around the \nworld to manufacture these products at a high quality and \ngreat\u00a0value. \n\nReducing Emissions from the \nTransportation of Data Center Hardware\n\nAWS is reducing emissions from transporting \nhardware, including racks and their related \ncomponents, by using more sustainable fuels \nand less carbon-intensive modes of shipping \nwhere\u00a0possible.\n\n\u2022  Increasing ocean freight: In 2023, AWS \n\ntransported approximately 6,600 metric tons \nof hardware components on cargo ships, \navoiding approximately 65,000 metric tons of \nCO2e by reducing airfreight in favor of ocean \nfreight where possible. \n\n\u2022  Investing in lower-carbon fuels: AWS is \nencouraging its suppliers to decarbonize \nlong-haul transportation, including through \nthe use of\u00a0SAF. In 2023, AWS purchased \nover 6\u00a0million liters of SAF, which avoided \napproximately 15,600 metric tons of CO2e \ncompared to conventional aviation fuel. \n\n\u2022  Making ground deliveries using EVs: AWS \nis increasing the use of EVs for equipment-\nrelated ground deliveries. In Dublin and \nSingapore, for example, AWS worked with \ntransportation providers to transport racks, \nloose gear, and other components to data \ncenter locations using electric trucks.\n\nCarbon emissions from the materials and manufacturing \nof these products are part of our Scope 3 carbon footprint. \nWe know that supporting our suppliers\u2019 understanding of \nthe factors that influence a product\u2019s carbon footprint can \nenable future innovation and avoid carbon emissions across \nour supply chain.\n\nIn 2023, we worked with our top suppliers to develop carbon \nfootprints for the products responsible for over half the \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of our private brands. These \ninsights informed the creation of joint abatement plans, which \nhelp avoid future product emissions through actions including \nmoving to recycled materials, using renewable energy to \npower manufacturing facilities, and reducing packaging. \nFor example, we began using recycled polyester certified \nby Textile Exchange\u2019s Global Recycled Standard, which now \nrepresents 16% of the polyester we use for Amazon Essentials \napparel products. We also worked with Amazon Private \nBrands battery suppliers to reduce product packaging weight \nby 13%. In 2024, we aim to expand our product carbon \nmeasurement activities to a larger group of suppliers.\n\nLearn more about how we focus on sustainability \nthroughout the lifecycle of our products\u00a0\n\nAmazon Grocery and Whole Foods Market\n\nAmazon Grocery and Whole Foods Market teams are working \nwith HowGood\u2014an independent research company and data \nplatform with the world\u2019s largest database on food product \nsustainability\u2014to measure and improve the impact of our \nfood products across multiple categories, including carbon \nemissions, soil health, and water usage. HowGood measures \nthe carbon footprint of our products based on each product\u2019s \ningredient breakdown, sourcing locations, and certifications, \ninstead of using industry averages. This gives us a more \naccurate understanding of our carbon footprint, allowing \nus to identify emissions hotspots and prioritize abatement \nsolutions with our suppliers.\n\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue ChainWaterWaste and CircularityPackagingCarbon-Free EnergyCarbon\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n21\n\nWhole Foods Market also actively supports and finances \nprojects that have the potential to strengthen ecosystem \nservices, promote biodiversity, and improve soil health within \nour supply chain. These projects include manure management \nwith dairy farmers, planting native grasses on farms in \ncollaboration with grain and legume suppliers, and process \nelectrification and feed efficiency with seafood\u00a0suppliers.\n\nDevices\nAmazon\u2019s sustainability strategy considers the entire \nlifecycle of our devices\u2014from how we build them to how \nour customers use and retire them. We strive to make \neach generation of new Amazon devices more carbon- and \nenergy-efficient and less resource-intensive than the last. \n\nIn 2023, we published the carbon footprint of newly \nlaunched\u00a0Echo, eero, Ring, Fire TV, and Fire tablet devices \non the product detail pages of our U.S. Amazon.com site, \nalong with product sustainability fact sheets for each device. \nFact sheets provide customers with a detailed breakdown of \nemissions throughout the device\u2019s lifecycle, including those \nresulting from the extraction, production, and transportation \nof raw materials and device parts; the energy associated with \ndevice use; and end-of-life processing.\u00a0We also published the \n \nAmazon Devices Product Carbon Footprint Methodology\u00a0\nto give customers insight into how we calculate the carbon \nfootprint of our devices.\n\nMany of our devices offer a Low Power Mode feature, which \nreduces energy consumption when the device is idle. Our \nlatest Echo and Fire TV devices, for example, feature\u00a0Low \nPower Mode, and we are delivering updates to introduce this \nfeature in older devices already in use. By the end of 2023, \nover 67% of Echo devices and Fire TVs had Low Power Mode, \nup from over 60% in 2022.\n\nAmazon supports the development of new renewable energy \ncapacity to match the electricity used by our customers\u2019 \ndevices. This renewable energy comes from investments \nin off-site wind and solar farms. Amazon may choose to \npurchase additional environmental attributes, such as \n\nrenewable energy certificates in the U.S. and Guarantees of \nOrigin in the EU, to signal our support for renewable energy \nin the grids where we operate, in line with the expected \nenergy generation of the projects we\u2019ve contracted. By the \nend of 2022, we had contracted enough renewable energy \ncapacity through new wind and solar farms to equal the \nexpected electricity used by all active Echo, Fire TV, and \nRing devices globally by 2025. Some of these wind and solar \nprojects are operational today; others are currently under \nconstruction and expected to begin operating in 2024.\n\nLearn more about how we calculate the percentage of \nrenewable energy matched to the electricity used by \nAmazon devices\u00a0\n\nIn 2022, we announced a collaboration with the Carbon \nTrust, which partners with businesses, governments, and \norganizations around the world to accelerate the transition \nto net-zero carbon emissions. We work with the Carbon \nTrust on technical specifications for decarbonizing the use \nphase of internet-connected devices. As part of this work, \nthroughout 2023, we partnered with Samsung, Meta, \nMicrosoft, and Comcast to develop standards that provide \npractical,\u00a0meaningful steps for mitigating emissions at the \ncustomer use stage of the device lifecycle.\n\nReducing embodied carbon in our hardware requires us \nto decarbonize all parts of the device lifecycle, including \nmanufacturing. We encourage Amazon device suppliers to \nreduce their manufacturing emissions, including by using \nrenewable energy. As of the end of 2023, we\u2019ve received \ncommitments from 49 device suppliers to work with us \non decarbonization, up from 28 suppliers in 2022. We \nalso helped 21 suppliers develop renewable energy plans, \nincluding final assembly suppliers that make up over 70% of \nour direct manufacturing spend for Echo, Kindle, Fire tablet, \nFire TV, Ring, Blink, and eero devices and accessories. \n\nLearn more about how we make our products with \nsustainability in mind\u00a0\n\nEngaging Suppliers\u00a0\nAs we progress on our net-zero carbon emissions journey, \nAmazon is continuing to engage suppliers in the critical work \nof reducing their operational emissions and working with \ntheir own upstream supply chains to do the same. We have \nidentified a list of the highest-emitting suppliers directly \nsupporting our operations, and expect those suppliers, who \ncollectively contribute more than 50% of emissions globally \nto Amazon\u2019s Scope 3 footprint, to provide a plan for how \nthey will decarbonize their operations and demonstrate real \nprogress over time. We will prioritize our business toward \nthose who provide their plans and results on their path to \nnet-zero carbon emissions. In addition, we also launched our \n\u201cAmazon Sustainability Exchange\u201d\u2014a free, publicly available \nwebsite that democratizes our guidelines, playbooks, science \nmodels, and other resources to help other companies make \nmeaningful progress toward net-zero carbon emissions.\n\nLearn more about how our new Amazon Sustainability \nExchange is helping our selling partners reach their \nsustainability goals\u00a0\n\nCarbon Neutralization\nAmazon\u2019s first priority under The Climate Pledge is to \neliminate emissions within the value chain of our businesses, \nkeeping pace with science-aligned pathways to the \ntemperature targets established by the Paris Agreement. \nIn parallel, we are investing in climate mitigation outside \nof our value chain (\u201ccarbon neutralization\u201d), and we plan to \nneutralize any emissions that cannot be eliminated by 2040. \nWe\u2019re making targeted investments and developing science-\nled partnerships that are making an impact today, while \nalso aiming to inspire global climate action and build the \nfoundation for credible neutralization initiatives at scale.\n\nOur carbon neutralization approach focuses on three \nactions\u00a0outside of our value chain. Based on climate science, \nwe know that these areas have a significant unmet need for \ninvestment and can deliver critical mitigation benefits: \n\n1. Reducing deforestation\n2. Advancing the removal of carbon from the atmosphere \n\nwith nature-based solutions\n\n3. Scaling up carbon removal technologies\n\nToday\u2019s carbon credit market is fragmented, complex, and \nopaque. At Amazon, we use the best available science to \ndesign and evaluate projects and measure, verify, and \nmonitor carbon credits.9 We also use robust methodologies \nto verify that the projects we support do, in fact, neutralize \ncarbon. In doing so, we are paving the way for a future \nwhere carbon credits are a quantifiable, real, permanent, and \nsocially beneficial method by which to reduce and remove \ncarbon from the atmosphere.\n\nIn recent years, we\u2019ve focused on developing and improving \nnew methods to better evaluate the effectiveness of\u00a0forest \nrestoration projects. As part of an independent working \ngroup made up of leading carbon market experts, scientists, \nand conservation professionals, we helped develop ABACUS, \na rigorous set of principles and requirements for quantifying \nthe climate benefits of restoration projects.\n\nABACUS aims to quantify the complete set of climate impacts \nassociated with restoration projects. One example of this is \n\u201cleakage:\u201d when a project designed to restore forests displaces \nproduction and leads to deforestation somewhere else. \nABACUS requires projects to maintain or enhance agricultural \nproduction to avoid leakage. ABACUS also requires a data-\ndriven dynamic baseline that compares carbon removal \nprogress over time to control areas that are not restored.\n\nReducing Deforestation\n\nWe have made an ambitious pledge to protect nature and \nmitigate climate change through the Lowering Emissions by \n\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue ChainWaterWaste and CircularityPackagingCarbon-Free EnergyCarbon\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n22\n\nAccelerating Forest finance (LEAF) Coalition\u2014a public-private \ninitiative that is mobilizing more than $1\u00a0billion to protect \nthe world\u2019s tropical forests and surrounding communities by \nsupporting government policies and programs that reduce \nemissions from deforestation at national or large sub-\nnational scale.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon provided funding and technology to \nhelp the State of Par\u00e1, Brazil, institute traceability in the \ncattle sector, advance alternative livelihoods for family \nfarmers, deter illegal land use by streamlining and digitizing \nproper land titling, and reclaim illegally deforested state \nlands. AWS is supporting the government of the State of \nPar\u00e1 in designing and deploying SeloVerde (Green Seal), a \ncutting-edge AI tool to address climate change challenges \nand traceability in supply chains with a high risk of \ndeforestation. SeloVerde combines government databases, \ninnovative map services, and land-use data from high spatial \nresolution satellite imagery. This allows industry stakeholders \naccess to information that helps them make environmentally \nresponsive, data-based purchasing decisions for commodities \nsuch as cattle and soy.\n\nAdvancing the Removal of Carbon from the \nAtmosphere with Nature-Based Solutions\n\nNature-based carbon removal, when done well, harnesses \nthe power of photosynthesis to enhance the carbon stored \nin natural and managed ecosystems, like forests and \ngrasslands. These projects have the additional benefit of \nhelping preserve the natural world by creating wildlife \nhabitat, promoting biodiversity, improving water quality, and \nreducing flood risk.\n\nIn 2023, we expanded our investments in nature-based \ncarbon removal with two new agroforestry projects in the \nAmazon rainforest. Located in Peru and Brazil, these projects \naim to integrate trees into farming systems while improving \nthe livelihoods of surrounding farming communities. \nAdditionally, they demonstrate an innovative new quality \nstandard for measuring and verifying carbon removal in \nagroforestry and restoration projects.\n\nWe also created the Agroforestry and Restoration \nAccelerator, which aims to restore degraded lands in ways \nthat both remove carbon from the atmosphere and improve \nthe livelihoods of local communities. The Accelerator \nexperiments with scalable business models, landholder \nengagement strategies, and measurement techniques to \nsupport agroforestry and native restoration on small-scale \nfamily farms in Brazil.\n\nLearn more about how we are advancing nature-based \nsolutions\u00a0\n\nScaling Up Carbon Removal Technologies\n\nIn 2023, we signed an agreement to support what is \nexpected to be the world\u2019s largest deployment of direct air \ncapture (DAC). DAC is an emerging set of technologies that \nchemically scrub CO2 from the air. The captured CO2 is then \nstored deep underground or used in applications such as \nbuilding materials (including concrete, brick, and cement) \nand low-carbon fuels. We committed to purchasing carbon \ndioxide removal credits equaling 250,000 metric tons of CO2 \nfrom 1PointFive, which is currently constructing its first DAC \nplant in Texas. When fully operational, the plant is expected \nto be the largest in the world, with capacity to capture up to \n500,000 metric tons of CO2 annually.\n\nAmazon also supports CarbonCapture Inc., a climate \ntechnology startup recognized for its pioneering modular \nDAC systems. The company\u2019s patented\u00a0modular open \nsystems architecture allows the swapping of new sorbents\u2014\nmaterials used to absorb CO2\u2014as they become available. \nMaximizing sorbent performance is one way to drive down \nthe cost of DAC over time to unlock scale. CarbonCapture Inc. \nwill make up to 100,000 carbon removal credits available \nto Amazon. The Climate Pledge Fund also made an equity \ninvestment in CarbonCapture Inc. to help accelerate its \ngrowth and scale its operations.\n\nLearn more about Amazon\u2019s Right Now Climate Fund\u00a0\n\nThe Climate Pledge\nThe Climate Pledge is a commitment to reach net-zero carbon \nemissions by 2040. Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge \nwith Global Optimism in 2019 and was the first company to \nsign on. The Climate Pledge brings the world\u2019s top companies \ntogether to drive joint action, cross-sector collaboration, and \nresponsible change. Companies signing up to The Climate \nPledge agree to the following three areas of\u00a0action:\n\n\u2022  Regular reporting: Measure and report GHG\u00a0emissions \n\non a regular basis.\n\n\u2022  Carbon elimination: Implement decarbonization \n\nstrategies in line with the Paris Agreement through \nbusiness change and innovations, including efficiency \nimprovements, renewable energy, materials reductions, \nand other carbon emissions elimination strategies.\n\n\u2022  Credible offsets: Neutralize any remaining emissions \n\nwith additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and \nsocially beneficial offsets to achieve net-zero annual \ncarbon emissions by 2040.\n\nThe Climate Pledge celebrates its fifth anniversary in \nSeptember 2024. While companies will chart their own paths \nto net-zero carbon emissions, signing The Climate Pledge \nreinforces their commitment to sustainability, holds them \naccountable to their goals, and provides new opportunities \nfor collaboration and a collective knowledge base to \naccelerate their progress. At the end of 2023, The Climate \nPledge represented 473 signatories in 42 countries and \n59\u00a0industries.\n\nIn 2023, 77 additional companies signed The Climate \nPledge, including Mastercard, Sony, and T-Mobile. Amazon \nencourages our suppliers to sign The Climate Pledge, and \nin 2023, nine Amazon transportation and logistics suppliers \nbecame signatories, including CTT Portugal Post, Global Feed \nEcotrans, Poste Italiane, and Emirates Post.\n\nThe Climate Pledge by the Numbers\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023 YoY%\n\nSignatories\n\n300\n\n396\n\n473\n\nCountries\n\nIndustries\n\n29\n\n51\n\n36\n\n55\n\n42\n\n59\n\n19%\n\n17%\n\n7%\n\nPartnering\u00a0with Others to Scale Progress\n\nWith 473 signatories, The Climate Pledge focused more on \ncross-industry collaboration in 2023 than ever before. In \n2023, The Climate Pledge launched five joint action projects \ninvolving its signatories to accelerate progress to net-zero \ncarbon emissions by 2040. Working together, signatories \naddressed tough problems in hard-to-abate sectors to \npromote technological innovation, send demand signals, \naddress supply chain conundrums, and encourage the \nintegration of climate justice business practices. So far, 24 \nsignatories have joined The Climate Pledge projects related \nto lower-emission supply chain transportation solutions, \ncircularity, increasing urban charging infrastructure, \nelectrifying middle mile freight, and data transparency.\n\nLaneshift is one example of The Climate Pledge\u2019s joint action \nprojects. In 2023, The Climate Pledge and C40, a global \nnetwork of nearly 100 mayors of the world\u2019s leading cities, \ndeveloped Laneshift to accelerate the transition to zero-\nemission electric trucks and charging infrastructure across \nmajor cities in India and Latin America.

By scaling \ncarbon-free energy, we aim to make Amazon a more resilient \nand more sustainable business, drive a global transition to \ncleaner energy, and achieve our commitment to The Climate \nPledge to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. \n\nCarbon-free energy includes existing renewable energy \ntechnologies, such as wind and solar farms and on-site \nrooftop solar systems, as well as nuclear reactors that \ngenerate carbon-free energy and other sources such as \nhydroelectric and geothermal. It also includes site energy \ncontracts and green tariffs with local utilities that result in \nnew wind and solar projects being added to the grid. There is \nnot a one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to transitioning \nto carbon-free energy, and we believe that all viable and \nscalable options should be considered.\n\nShifting to carbon-free energy requires a targeted, \nmultifaceted approach. We are taking action to achieve our \ngoals in the following ways:\n\n\u2022  Energy efficiency: We innovate to continuously improve \n\nthe energy efficiency of our operations and devices. \nWe\u2019re also improving data collection and analysis to \nbetter understand our operational energy requirements. \nThis informs our carbon-free procurement decisions and \nenergy optimization initiatives.\n\nLearn more about how we are\u00a0increasing \nenergy\u00a0efficiency\u00a0\n\n\u2022  Scaling renewable energy projects: We invest in on-\nsite renewables through rooftop solar installations on \nbuildings we operate, as well as in off-site renewables \nthrough power purchase agreements (PPAs) that fund \n\nnew utility-scale wind and solar projects. We also \nparticipate in green tariff programs with utilities and \npursue new renewable projects through competitive site \nenergy contracts. Renewable energy certificates in the \nU.S. and Guarantees of Origin in the EU help us bridge \nthe gap between project inception and operation\u2014when \nthe project actually starts to power our buildings or feed \nrenewable energy into the grid.\n\nWind and solar will continue to be a critical piece of \nour energy strategy as we expand our investments into \nadditional forms of carbon-free energy, including nuclear. \nWe\u2019ll continue to evaluate our energy strategy to meet the \nneeds of our customers and achieve our commitment to \nreach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.\n\nLearn more about our approach in our Renewable \nEnergy\u00a0Methodology\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\u2022  Energy storage solutions: We are expanding battery \n\nenergy storage capacity to support the decarbonization \nof electricity grids.\n\n\u2022  Diversifying carbon-free energy sources: In addition to \n\nwind and solar, we are exploring and investing in other \ncarbon-free energy sources, such as nuclear, that can \nhelp match the electricity consumed by our operations \nfor the long term as our business grows.\n\n\u2022  Partnerships and advocacy for carbon-free energy \n\nsolutions: We engage in partnerships, industry \ninitiatives, and public policy advocacy to advance access \nto and the expansion of carbon-free energy for Amazon, \nour customers, and the communities where we operate. \n\nAs part of our commitment to The Climate Pledge, we set \ntwo renewable energy goals that are central to our broader \ncarbon-free energy approach: to match all the electricity \nconsumed by our operations with 100% renewable energy \nand to invest in wind and solar capacity equal to the \nelectricity used by all active Echo, Fire TV, and Ring devices \nworldwide. Additionally, we\u2019re asking our suppliers to use \nmore renewable energy, engaging product and device \nsuppliers to set goals to decarbonize their own operations, \nand working with suppliers on initiatives to reduce their \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.\u00a0\n\nThe Baldy Mesa Solar and Storage Project in Adelanto,  \nCalifornia (developed and operated by AES), represents one of \nthe solar projects that we added to our portfolio that includes  \nstorage capacity.\n\nOur Progress\n\nScaling Renewable Energy\nIn 2014, Amazon made our first investment in a renewable \nenergy project at a time when corporate procurement for \nsolar and wind power was just beginning. In 2019, we set \nan ambitious goal to match 100% of the electricity we use \nwith renewable energy by 2030. This goal includes all data \ncenters, logistics facilities, physical stores, and corporate \noffices, as well as on-site charging points and our financially \nintegrated subsidiaries. We are proud to have achieved this \ngoal in 2023, seven years early, with 100% of the electricity \nconsumed by Amazon matched with renewable energy \nsources, up from 90% in 2022. This achievement is an \nimportant step on our journey to achieve net-zero carbon \nemissions by 2040, and we will continue to focus on reducing \nemissions through carbon-free energy as part of our \ncommitment to The Climate Pledge. \n\nOur journey has included enabling major solar, wind, and \nbattery storage projects around the world, including the first \nwind farm in Mississippi, and becoming the first corporate \n\nAs of January 2024, Amazon had announced:\n\n513  Global renewable energy projects\n243 Utility-scale wind and solar projects\n270 Solar rooftops at our facilities and stores\n\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue ChainWaste and CircularityPackagingCarbon-Free EnergyCarbonWater\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n26\n\nAmazon Renewable Energy Projects* \nProjects announced as of January 2024.\n\nProject Location\n\nAustralia\nAustria\nBelgium\nBrazil\nCanada\nChina\nFinland\nFrance\nGermany\nGreece\nIndia\nIndonesia\nIreland\nItaly\nJapan\nNetherlands\nNew Zealand\nPoland\nSaudi Arabia\nSingapore\nSouth Africa\nSouth Korea\nSpain\nSweden\nUnited Arab Emirates\nUnited Kingdom\nUnited States\nTotal\n\nNumber \nof Projects\n\nTotal MW \nCapacity\u2020\n\n7\n1\n1\n2\n4\n4\n9\n7\n6\n1\n50\n1\n3\n27\n13\n1\n1\n4\n1\n2\n2\n1\n79\n5\n1\n36\n244\n513\n\n389\n0.03\n1\n172\n875\n450\n439\n40\n678\n24\n1,141\n210\n205\n148\n114\n380\n51\n142\n2\n64\n28\n60\n2,983\n787\n3\n901\n17,706\n27,993\n\npurchaser to invest in renewable energy projects in countries \nsuch as Indonesia, Poland, and South Africa. This led us to \npurchase more renewable energy than any other corporation \nin the world.\n\nCollectively, these projects represent 28 gigawatts (GW) \nof renewable energy capacity, making Amazon the world\u2019s \nlargest corporate purchaser of renewable energy for the \nfourth year in a row. Once operational, these projects are \nexpected to generate more than 77,000 gigawatt-hours \n(GWh) of renewable energy each year\u2014enough energy to \npower 7.3 million homes for a year and an increase of 35% \nfrom 57,000 GWh in 2022. \n\nIn 2023, we announced investments in more than 100 new \nsolar and wind energy projects, expanded our renewables \nportfolio into 27 countries, including adding projects \nin Canada, Greece, and South Korea, and launched new \nrenewable energy projects in 17 U.S. states.11\n\nUtility-Scale Wind and Solar Projects\n\nAltogether, Amazon had 243 utility-scale wind and solar \nprojects, including 42\u00a0newly operational ones, in 2023.\u00a0We \nhave also\u00a0signed\u00a0274\u00a0PPAs as of January 2024 that will \ncollectively add 3.7 GW of clean energy to the grid, bringing \nour total contracted clean energy generation to\u00a027 GW. \nAdditionally, Amazon participated in two green tariff \nagreements in 2023.\u00a0These\u00a0allow commercial and industrial \ncustomers to buy bundled renewable electricity from a \nspecific project through a special utility tariff rate.\n\nWe expanded our renewable energy footprint across the \nsoutheastern U.S. in new ways in 2023, including by adding \nfive new solar and wind projects, bringing our total number \nof renewable energy projects in the region to\u00a030. Our latest \nprojects include Mississippi\u2019s first utility-scale wind farm \nand multiple solar farms in states such as Arkansas and \nGeorgia. Once fully operational, these projects are expected \nto generate more than 7,500 GWh of renewable energy. We \nalso started producing renewable energy from nearly 5,600 \nrooftop solar panels installed at the Amazon Air Hub at the \nCincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. This \n\nsystem is expected to generate enough energy to power \nroughly 400 average-sized homes per year.\n\nLearn more about the model in the Economic Impact of \nAmazon Investment in Renewables Methodology\u00a0\n\nIn 2023, Amazon announced 39 new renewable energy \nprojects across Europe, adding more than 1 GW of renewable \nenergy capacity to grids in the region. Our total capacity of \nrenewable energy in Europe is now\u00a07 GW, including 1.7 GW \nof renewable energy from offshore wind. Offshore wind \nturbines are an important source of renewable energy due to \nthe volume they produce and their reliability, as winds tend \nto be higher and more consistent at sea. In January 2024, \nAmazon signed a corporate PPA with the low-carbon energy \nand services company ENGIE to increase our share of output \nfrom the Moray West offshore wind farm in Scotland to 473 \nmegawatts (MW) once the site becomes operational in 2024.\n\nAmazon also accelerated renewable energy investments \nacross the Asia-Pacific region in 2023, including by adding 24 \nnew utility-scale solar and wind projects to our portfolio. We \nunveiled three new utility-scale renewable energy projects in \nIndia, including a 198 MW wind farm in Osmanabad. In China, \nwe announced two new wind farms in Daqing and Bobai. We \nalso invested in new solar projects in Japan, New Zealand, \nand Australia.\n\nAlong with bringing new renewable energy sources to \nmarket, these solar and wind farm projects generate \neconomic growth in local communities around the world.\u00a0To \ntrack the benefits that these projects deliver, Amazon \ndeveloped an industry-leading economic model that follows \nguidance from the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National \nRenewable Energy Laboratory and was independently \nvalidated by Oxford Economics. The model estimates the \ninvestment generated by the construction and operation of \nutility-scale solar and wind farms, including direct economic \neffects (hiring and spending by the developer) and indirect \neffects (hiring and spending by suppliers and workers). The \nmodel found that from 2014 through 2022, Amazon\u2019s solar \nand wind farms generated over $12\u00a0billion in community \ninvestments around the world and supported 39,000 full-\ntime-equivalent jobs at direct suppliers and at businesses in \nAmazon\u2019s downstream supply chain globally in 2022 alone.\u00a0\n\nOn-Site Solar Projects\n\nIn 2023, 50 new on-site solar energy systems became \noperational at our facilities and stores, adding 58 MW of \ncapacity. Altogether, these solar energy projects generate an \nestimated 123,000 MWh and avoid roughly 47,500 metric \ntons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO\u2082e) each year. \n\nWe launched our first on-site solar array with energy storage \nprojects in Bakersfield and San Bernardino, California, in \n2023. Additionally, we reached our first on-site solar array \ndeals in Ohio and in Belgium and Saudi Arabia. These \nprojects bring the total number of rooftop solar projects \nacross Amazon and Whole Foods Market facilities to 270, \nwith a total capacity of 344 MW. Altogether, these projects \navoid roughly 17 million metric tons of CO2e each year.\n\nData Centers Powered with Renewable Energy \n\nAmazon\u2019s energy supply from utilities, combined with the \nrenewable energy we procure globally, means that 100% of \nthe electricity consumed by\u00a022\u00a0AWS data center regions is \nmatched with renewable energy sources\u2014an increase from \n19 regions in 2022.\u2021\n\nAcross Amazon, we work with utilities and regulators \non green tariffs so that more companies can buy clean \nenergy directly from renewable energy projects. In eastern \nOregon, for instance, AWS partnered with Umatilla Electric \nCooperative\u2014the utility serving AWS data centers in \nthe area\u2014to create a first-of-its-kind deal structure in \nthe state that allows AWS to directly choose the energy \nsupply powering its data centers, including renewable \nenergy\u00a0sources.\n\nAlso in Oregon, Amazon\u2019s investment in the Gilliam County \nwind farm\u00a0is expected to add capacity\u00a0by replacing older \nwind turbine blades and equipment with modern technology, \nallowing for more efficient production of wind energy.

In certain cases (e.g., renewable energy in \n\nthe same grid is not available), AWS may procure renewable energy attributes in other locations.\n\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue ChainWaste and CircularityPackagingCarbon-Free EnergyCarbonWater\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n27\n\nwill work with local utilities to power AWS data centers in \neastern Oregon with renewable energy. \n\nBrownfield Solar Projects\n\nThere is an emerging opportunity to repurpose previously \npolluted, unused land to deliver economic and environmental \nbenefits for local communities. Brownfields are pieces of land \nthat have been abandoned due to pollution, such as mines, \nfactories, and landfills. The U.S. Environmental Protection \nAgency estimates that more than 450,000 brownfields could \nbe revitalized for solar energy projects across the country. \nBrownfields are often located near power lines and public \nroads, making it easier to connect these types of projects to \nthe grid.\n\nBrownfield solar projects repurpose previously polluted land into \nsolar farms.\n\nIn 2023, we announced plans to support the repurposing \nof a previously polluted Maryland coal mine into a solar \nfarm. Amazon Solar Farm Maryland\u2013CPV Backbone is under \nconstruction at the site of the recently closed Arch Coal Mine \nin Garrett County, Maryland. More than 1,100 acres of coal \nrefuse once contaminated this 120-year-old mining site, and \nthis land has since been reclaimed. \n\nThe project is expected to employ more than 200 skilled \nworkers during peak construction activities and provide \nmillions of dollars in local tax revenue. Once completed, it is \nexpected to be the largest solar farm in Maryland. Featuring \nmore than 326,000 solar panels,\u00a0Amazon Solar Farm \nMaryland\u2013CPV Backbone will avoid more than 64,000 metric \ntons of CO2e each year\u2014the equivalent of taking more than \n13,900 cars off the road.\n\nDiversifying Carbon-Free Energy Sources\n\nAs the demand for energy increases around the world, we are \nexpanding our investments in carbon-free energy solutions, \nincluding nuclear. For example, in early 2023, we purchased a \nnuclear-powered data center in Pennsylvania that is directly \npowered by the adjacent Susquehanna Steam Electric\u00a0Station. \n\nNuclear energy is a strong option that already has a proven \ntrack record of providing a constant source of reliable power \nfor communities around the world. Nuclear energy is the \nmost reliable, abundant, and stable energy source on the \ngrid, and Amazon\u2019s investment in nuclear power is part of \nour broader efforts to decarbonize the energy sector, and \nour\u00a0business. \n\nEnergy Storage Solutions\n\nWe invest in energy storage to collect and save renewable \nenergy for use when other energy sources may be \nunavailable\u2014such as at night or during periods of high \ndemand\u2014and to help improve grid stability. In 2023, we \nadded seven solar projects paired with battery energy \nstorage systems to our portfolio in the U.S. We now hold 1.3 \nGW of storage capacity, up from 445 MW in 2022.\n\nPartnerships and Advocacy for \nCarbon-Free\u00a0Energy Solutions\nSupporting a More Just, Equitable, and \nSustainable Clean Energy Transition \n\nAs the world\u2019s largest corporate renewable energy\u00a0purchaser, \nwe have a unique role to play in supporting a more just, \nequitable, and sustainable clean energy transition. As a \nfounding member and active participant in Beyond the \nMegawatt\u2014an initiative from the Clean Energy Buyers \nAssociation (CEBA)\u2014we are helping scale results-oriented \nclean energy procurement strategies that put energy grid \nresiliency, social equity, and environmental protection \nat the forefront of solar and wind transactions. Beyond \nthe Megawatt partners with energy customers, energy \nand service providers, nongovernmental organizations, \nacademia, researchers, community organizations, and other \nbusinesses to help ensure a diversity of stakeholder voices \nare represented as we shift toward carbon-free energy. \nIn 2023, we participated in CEBA\u2019s equity and resilience \nworking groups, which produced industry-wide guidance \non incorporating biodiversity and social benefit standards \ninto\u00a0PPAs. \n\nScaling Up Carbon-Free Energy\n\nTo advance the transition to carbon-free energy within \nour supply chain, Amazon helped found the Clean Energy \nProcurement Academy (CEPA) with other leading companies \nin 2023. CEPA supports the adoption of clean energy by \nsuppliers through training and online educational resources. \nThe academy\u2019s founding organizations pooled their expertise \nand internal resources to design a shared training curriculum \nand delivery processes. Through our collaborative efforts \nwith fellow members and suppliers, this initiative aims to \nrapidly advance clean energy procurement, address Scope 3 \nemissions, and decarbonize global supply chains.\n\nWe also co-founded the Emissions First Partnership (EFP), \na coalition of companies committed to modernizing GHG \n\naccounting standards for the power sector, as part of our \nefforts to decarbonize power grids. Through our work with \nEFP, we have continued to advocate for updated carbon \naccounting guidelines for the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. \nThese revised standards are designed to make carbon \naccounting more closely resemble the real-world carbon \neffects of an organization\u2019s actions. The standards will also \nprovide more opportunities for organizations to invest in \ndecarbonization initiatives such as clean energy projects\u2014\nespecially in markets where there is the ability and resources \nto decarbonize the power system faster.\n\nLearn more about how we are working to decarbonize our \nsupply chain\u00a0\n\nAdvocating for Improved Infrastructure  \nand Policies\n\nWe have made significant progress in procuring renewable \nenergy for our business, supply chain, and surrounding \ncommunities. However, there are a number of challenges \nto scaling up renewables, including project delays, long \ntimelines due to interconnection queues, and the lack of a \nstrong policy framework.\n\nSupporting Grid Improvements\n\nThe widespread transition to carbon-free power requires \nan upgraded and expanded electricity grid. In the U.S., \ninsufficient transmission capacity is gridlocking renewable \nenergy deployment. The demand for renewables is \noverwhelming\u2014projects waiting to get on the grid exceed \nthe system\u2019s overall capacity to support them. With a \ngrowing number of renewable projects in the pipeline, \nadvancing policies and incentives to enable and encourage \nthe much-needed build-out of the transmission system will \nbe vital.\n\nWe recommended to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission (FERC) that it require transmission providers to \nconsider a broader array of transmission needs, including \ncorporate commitments for renewable energy procurement. \nIn 2023, we continued our work to require utilities and grid \n\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue ChainWaste and CircularityPackagingCarbon-Free EnergyCarbonWater\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n28\n\nplanners to deploy grid-enhancing technologies. These \ntechnologies can unlock capacity for and improve efficiencies \naround renewable energy by reducing congestion on existing \ngrid infrastructure. We are also working with a number of \norganizations, including PJM Interconnection, the regional \ngrid operator for the mid-Atlantic, and the Rocky Mountain \nInstitute, a nonprofit working to transform the global energy \n\nOur Amazon Air Hub located at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky \nInternational Airport is home to Kentucky\u2019s largest solar array, \ncreated in collaboration with Duke Energy.\n\nsystem to secure a clean, prosperous, zero-carbon future, \nto improve capacity on existing lines and bring renewable \nenergy to the grid at a much lower cost than that of \ntraditional solutions.\n\nWe continued our advocacy work with U.S. regulators in \n2023 to improve transmission planning, permitting, and \ninterconnection processes, including calling for federal \ntransmission permitting reform in Congress. We also \njoined advocacy groups such as Western Freedom and \nRenewable Northwest in support of their efforts to create \nan organized wholesale electricity market in the western \nU.S. Amazon publicly supported and advocated for SB-410 \n(Powering Up Californians Act), a new law to speed up utility \ninterconnection processes, which passed in the California \nlegislature with bipartisan support and was signed into law \nby the governor. \n\nAnticipating Future Energy Demand \nPowered by AWS\n\nAWS is collaborating with Duke Energy, which \noperates the largest electrical grid in the U.S., to \nbuild new smart grid software and services that \nanticipate future energy demand and identify \nwhere and how to update the power grid. By \nrunning on AWS, Duke Energy\u2019s Intelligent Grid \nServices will provide more accurate forecasting \nof electricity needs in a matter of minutes, rather \nthan the weeks it would take with traditional \ninformation technology hardware. This in turn \nenables Duke Energy to make smarter decisions, \nincluding about where to replace equipment \nor implement non-wire alternatives, which \nare electrical grid investments intended to \ndefer or eliminate the need to construct or \nupgrade\u00a0components.\n\nPromoting Robust Renewable Energy Policies\nWe work with decision-makers around the world to advance \npolicies that scale up renewable energy. In 2023, we backed \na new global renewable energy goal, urging world leaders at \nCOP28 to triple renewable energy capacity to at least 11,000 \nGW by 2030.\n\nIn the U.S., we are focusing on accelerating the addition \nof new renewable energy projects to the grid. In 2023, we \nadvocated for grid planners to be required to prioritize \nprojects that are \u201cready to be brought online,\u201d instead \nof projects that submitted queue applications first. FERC \nadopted this shift to a \u201cfirst-ready, first-served\u201d model \nin\u00a02023. We also encouraged the Bonneville Power \nAdministration in the Pacific Northwest to adopt first-\nready, first-served queue reforms, which they did in 2024, \nfacilitating increased production of clean energy across \nthe region. In Ireland, we encouraged the Commission for \nRegulation of Utilities (CRU) to create a pathway for offshore \nwind projects to be delivered through corporate purchasing. \nCRU agreed and extended the timeline for offshore wind \nprojects to be available for corporate buyers such as Amazon.\n\nBecause permitting for renewable energy projects is one key \nfactor delaying clean energy deployment, we are working \nwith legislators, advocacy organizations, and corporate \npartners to drive permitting efficiencies across Europe and \nhelp reduce delays. In Poland, we called for policymakers \nto loosen restrictions on permitting and locating wind \nprojects as its government works to increase the amount of \nrenewable energy on its grid. As a result of our and others\u2019 \nwork, Poland\u2019s government partially reduced its permitting \nrestrictions in 2023, allowing more renewable energy \nprojects to be developed there.\n\nIn addition, AWS is collaborating with WindEurope and \nAccenture to develop EasyPermits, a digital permitting \nsolution running on AWS that increased the efficiency of \nthe administrative permitting process, enabling shortened \npermitting timelines to help the EU meet its 2030 \nrenewable energy targets. EasyPermits is a secure web-\nbased cloud solution that addresses key challenges faced \nby permitting agents and project developers to increase \n\nthe speed and amount of renewable energy on the grid. \nThis tool is currently available to support onshore wind \nprojects, has been successfully tested in two municipalities \nin Denmark, and will continue to scale to support carbon-\nfree energy policy objectives. Through our Danish pilot, \nEasyPermits reportedly enabled concurrent processing of \nup to\u00a0three\u00a0times as many permit applications and delivered \na 50% reduction in administrative workload by improving \ntransparency and information\u00a0management.\n\nOur advocacy to scale renewable energy extends around \nthe globe. In Japan, Amazon worked with third-party \norganizations to advocate for virtual PPAs, allowing \ncorporate buyers to increase the number of projects \nthat will be built through their own initiatives. In South \nAfrica, we partnered with the City of Cape Town to pilot a \n\u201cpower wheeling\u201d project. Power wheeling uses the city\u2019s \ntransmission or distribution system to distribute energy \nbetween different grids or service areas. As a result of the \npilot, energy customers in the city can now invest in and \naccess renewable energy projects. \n\nLooking Forward\nWe remain focused on scaling carbon-free energy across our \ncompany and the communities we operate in. In 2024 and \nbeyond, we will continue to add more carbon-free energy \ngeneration and storage capacity to our portfolio as we scale \nup new technologies such as AI and work toward our goal to \nachieve net-zero carbon by 2040. This will include investing \nin more solar and wind energy projects, such as our Moray \nWest offshore wind farm in Scotland\u00a0\nAs we progress toward decarbonizing our business, we will \nalso engage with our partners, industry associations, and \nregulators around the world to scale our work, share what \nwe\u2019ve learned, and advocate for infrastructure and policies \nthat help create a carbon-free energy future. We\u2019ve always \nsaid that the path to net-zero carbon won\u2019t be linear.

We think locally, taking into consideration factors \nsuch as location and geography, average delivery distance \nto customers, vehicle type, and delivery method. As we \nregionalize our network, products travel shorter distances \nto customers and need less protective packaging.\u00a0We move \nquickly to invest in responsible shipping and packaging \ninnovations that can scale our program to ship products \nwithout additional packaging.\n\nAs we continue to learn and evolve our packaging strategy, \nwe focus on the following priorities:\n\n\u2022  We avoid unnecessary packaging whenever possible \nthrough our Ships in Product Packaging program and \nwork with suppliers to re-engineer their packaging to \nqualify for the program.\n\n\u2022  When supplemental Amazon packaging is required, \nwe select lighter, right-sized options to reduce our \npackaging footprint while still protecting the item.  \nWe use artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize packaging \ntypes\u2014from bags to boxes\u2014and sizes, depending on \nthe level of protection needed.\n\nShips in Product Packaging\nMany products can be shipped safely without protection \nfrom additional Amazon delivery bags or boxes, which is the \nmain idea behind our Ships in Product Packaging program. \nThrough this program, we deliver eligible items in the \nmanufacturers\u2019 original packaging without supplemental \nAmazon delivery packaging, allowing us to avoid unnecessary \nmaterial use and reduce the weight of deliveries. Our aim \nis to continue to increase the number of products shipped \nthrough the program so that we can further reduce our \npackaging use and avoid incremental carbon emissions \nassociated with additional materials and weight.\n\nAs we focus on shipping more items without additional \ndelivery bags or boxes, we\u2019ve challenged ourselves to ship \nsome of the most complex products without additional \npackaging\u2014such as TVs, glassware, and toys. We are able \nto then use those learnings and apply them to less complex \nproducts that may need only small adjustments to qualify \nfor the Ships in Product Packaging program. As we set new \nstandards required to qualify for the program, we\u2019re also \nable to identify and onboard products that do not need \nany\u00a0adjustments.\n\n\u2022  We prioritize materials that are household recyclable. We \n\nare also working on innovations and solutions to avoid \nsingle-use plastics, and we\u2019re reporting on our progress. \n\n\u2022  We work across the public and private sectors to \n\ncreate and scale recyclable and biodegradable \nmaterials, find circular solutions, and improve recycling \ninfrastructure\u00a0globally.\n\n to qualify for the program and expand the \n\nAmazon works with suppliers to re-engineer their \npackaging\u00a0\neligibility of products. For example, we worked with Hasbro \nto design a sturdier package for the Hasbro Galactic Heroes \nBB-8 Adventure toy that is 81% smaller, contains 20 \nfewer components, and is eligible for the Ships in Product \nPackaging program.\n\nTo make sure that our customers are aware of this program, \nwe let them know a product is shipping in its own packaging \n\nat checkout on Amazon websites in the U.S., Canada, and \nEurope. We also give customers the option to add Amazon \npackaging if desired.\n\nLearn more about the Ships in Product Packaging \nprogram\u00a0\n\nAround the World\n\nIn 2023, nearly 12 million products qualified for the Ships in \nProduct Packaging program, and 12% of Amazon packages \nglobally were shipped without additional packaging, \nincluding 13% in the U.S. and Canada, 9% in Europe, 3% in \nJapan, 19% in India, and 8% in Brazil, Mexico, and Singapore. \nThis progress is a result of continuing to identify products \nthat qualify for the program, working with selling partners \nto make packaging updates that allow their products \nto ship in their original packaging, and implementing \nregionalization. The last is Amazon\u2019s new delivery approach \nthat utilizes shorter routes across the U.S., expanding \neligibility for products to ship in their own packaging without \nrisking\u00a0damage.\n\nLearn more about regionalization\u00a0\n\nInspiring Selling Partners to Reduce Packaging\n\nOur Ships in Product Packaging program doesn\u2019t just offer \nenvironmental benefits. Less packaging also means lower \ncosts, and Amazon believes in sharing these cost savings with \nour selling partners. In 2023, we tested decreasing the cost \n\u00a0(FBA) for sellers who adopt the \nof Fulfillment by Amazon\u00a0\nprogram. In early 2024, we expanded this fee reduction to all \nFBA sellers with eligible products. The program is available to \nsellers in seven marketplaces: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, \nSpain, the UK, and the U.S.\n\n2023 Delivery Packaging by Region\n\nRegion\n\nEurope\n\nU.S. and Canada\n\nIndia\n\nShips in  \nProduct \n\nPackaging Flexibles\n\nCorrugated \nBoxes\n\n9%\n\n13%\n\n19%\n\n47%\n\n51%\n\n38%\n\n44%\n\n36%\n\n43%\n\nAmazon works with companies such as Windex to help re-engineer \ntheir packaging to qualify for the Ships in Product Packaging program.\n\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue ChainWaste and CircularityPackagingCarbon-Free EnergyCarbonWater\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n31\n\nOptimizing with Lighter, More \nFlexible, and Right-Sized \nPackaging\nWe strive to keep our packaging lightweight and minimal \nwhile ensuring deliveries reach customers without damage. \nLighter, more flexible, and right-sized packaging helps\u00a0reduce \ndelivery emissions per package by\u00a0using less material and \ntaking up less space in delivery vehicles. Since 2015, we have \ndecreased our average per-shipment packaging weight by \n43%, which represents more than 3 million metric tons of \npackaging materials avoided.\n\nWhen possible, Amazon uses lightweight packaging by \nprioritizing flexible paper bags and envelopes. In the U.S., \nthese flexible options are up to 89% lighter than similar-\nsized rigid corrugated boxes. With millions of products and \nan infinite number of order combinations, identifying the \noptimal packaging solution to keep each order safe during \ntransit represents a significant challenge. That is why we use \nmachine learning algorithms to determine the most efficient \noption for each order we fulfill.\n\nData scientists trained an AI model to understand a variety \nof product features, including shape and durability, and \nto analyze customer feedback on how different packaging \noptions have performed. The model is constantly learning \nand has helped reduce our use of packaging material since it \nlaunched in 2019.\n\nMachine learning algorithms also help us determine the best \nfit for orders with multiple items, so we can decrease empty \nspace in boxes. Optimized shipments require less space in \nthe vehicles that deliver packages to our customers, helping \nreduce the number of vehicles on the road.\n\nAnother way Amazon uses machine learning is to optimize \nthe suite of cardboard box options at any one facility. Our \nweb-based tools help identify and select a facility\u2019s suite of \nshipping box types based on the order patterns unique to \nthat facility. \n\nAmazon Delivery Packaging by Type\nWe aim to increase the number of products that ship in the manufacturers\u2019 original packaging without \nadditional packaging, as well as select lighter, right-sized options to reduce our packaging footprint.\n\nShips in Product \n\nPackaging\n\nFlexible Packaging \n\nPadded\n\nFlexible Packaging \n\nUnpadded\n\nCorrugated \n\nBoxes\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\n12%\n\n11%\n\n8%\n\n50% \n\n49%\n\n49%\n\n38%\n\n40%\n\n43%\n\nData represents shipments from the Amazon fulfillment network fulfilled through Amazon-owned and -operated fulfillment \ncenters across Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the U.S.\n\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue ChainWaste and CircularityPackagingCarbon-Free EnergyCarbonWater\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n32\n\n2023 Packaging Use by Region\n\nAverage  \nPackaging \nWeight  \nper Shipment \n(g/shipment)\n\nMetric Tons \nof Packaging \nMaterial \nEliminated\n\n96\n\n111\n\n112\n\n34,817\n\n33,529\n\n9,910\n\nRegion\n\nEurope\n\nU.S. and Canada\n\nIndia\n\nWe\u2019re testing new packaging machines in Europe and the U.S. that \nbuild made-to-fit paper bags around individual items on demand.\n\nPhasing Out Single-Use Plastics \nand Using More Recyclable \nPackaging\nAmazon is working to reduce our use of single-use plastic \npackaging in favor of household-recyclable alternatives. Like \nmost retailers, Amazon has traditionally used a mix of plastic \nand paper packaging to optimize for durability, weight, and \nsize. However, recycling plastic packaging generally requires \ncustomers to visit a drop-off location. To make recycling \nour packaging as easy as possible, our packaging engineers \nhave been researching and experimenting for years to ensure \nwe find the right solutions to deliver more products to \ncustomers with household-recyclable paper.\n\nThese packaging reduction initiatives have made a significant \nimpact, decreasing our average plastic packaging weight per \nshipment by 9% across Amazon\u2019s global operations network, \nbuilding on a 17% reduction in 2022. Altogether, we have \navoided 80,500 metric tons of single-use plastic packaging \nsince 2020. Efforts so far include our Ships in Product \nPackaging program, leveraging AI to identify where we can \nuse lighter, more flexible, right-sized packaging, replacing \nsingle-use plastic delivery packaging with 100% household-\nrecyclable paper and cardboard packaging in our fulfillment \nnetwork in Europe, and eliminating single-use, thin-film \nplastic packaging from our fulfillment network in India.15 \nWhile these reduction initiatives have slowed our plastic \npackaging use, our total plastic packaging increased 3% from \n86,055 metric tons in 2022 to 88,698 metric tons in 2023 \ndue to our business growth.16\n\nAdditionally, in October 2023, we announced our first \nautomated U.S. fulfillment center to eliminate plastic \ndelivery packaging as part of our multi-year effort to \neliminate plastic delivery packaging from our North America \nfulfillment centers. In June 2024, we announced a major \nmilestone for this effort, removing 95% of plastic air pillows \n\nfrom delivery packaging in North America, working toward \nfull removal by end of year. This will avoid the use of nearly \n15 billion plastic air pillows annually and will be our largest \nplastic packaging reduction effort in North America to date. \nWe will continue to build and test new innovations and \nimprove on the systems we have in place in order to decrease \nour use of single-use plastic packaging and share updates on \nthe progress we\u2019re making.\n\nWhile recycling infrastructure varies around the world, \nwe remain dedicated to designing packaging that is easier \nto recycle where such programs exist, while considering \nlocalized, country-specific challenges and how to solve them \nas part of our ongoing approach.\n\nEurope\n\nIn 2023, we announced that 100% of delivery packaging \nin Europe\u2014the boxes, bags, and envelopes needed to get \nproducts to customers\u2014was household recyclable, including \nfor items sold by Amazon and third-party selling partners \nthat use FBA. In total, 87 European fulfillment centers have \nstopped using plastic packaging for deliveries. \n\nUnited States and Canada\n\nIn 2023, we expanded our use of household-recyclable \npaper-padded bags across the U.S. and Canada, \nreplacing\u00a099.7% of padded bags containing both plastic and \npaper. This change has helped us avoid\u00a0nearly 41,600\u00a0metric \ntons of single-use plastic since 2020.\u00a0We also transitioned\u00a013 \nfulfillment centers from plastic to paper for dunnage, the \ndurable packing material used to protect goods during \nshipping. Furthermore, we are investing in research and \ndevelopment to identify better\u00a0paper alternatives for the rest \nof our packaging suite.\n\nIndia, Japan, and Rest of World \n\nSince Amazon\u00a0replaced thin-film single-use plastic packaging \n\nSingle-Use Plastic Packaging by Region\nSingle-Use \nPlastic \nPackaging \nAvoided since \n2020 (MT)\n\nSingle-Use  \nPlastic \nPackaging \nUsed in  \n2023 (MT)\n\nRegion\n\nEurope\n\nU.S. and Canada\n\nIndia\n\nJapan\n\nRest of World17\n\nTotal\n\n877\n\n83,513\n\n1,015\n\n931\n\n2,362\n\n88,698\n\n14,600\n\n41,600\n\n9,100\n\n13,400\n\n1,800\n\n80,500\n\nmaterial with paper- and cardboard-based packaging across \nour India fulfillment network in 2019,\u00a0we have avoided \na total of\u00a09,100 metric tons of plastic packaging in the \ncountry.

For larger \nshipments that require dunnage, we are working toward \nreplacing air pillows with paper alternatives. \n\nIn Japan,\u00a099.5%\u00a0of delivery packaging material is household \nrecyclable as of the end of 2023.\u00a0We anticipate that all sites \nin this country will participate in this program by the end \nof 2024. In 2023, Amazon removed plastic shrink-wrap film \nand replaced plastic cushioning materials, such as air pillows, \n\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue ChainWaste and CircularityPackagingCarbon-Free EnergyCarbonWater\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n33\n\nwith paper-based dunnage in Japan, except when packaging \nfragile items and gift packages.\u00a0We are also in the process of \nswitching from plastic packaging tape to paper tape. \n\nSince 2021, Amazon has utilized automated paper-bag \npackaging machines in Japan to optimize packaging size \nand material use and increase household recyclability. We \nexpanded this practice to Australia in 2023.\n\nMinimizing and Optimizing \nPackaging in Grocery\nTo make sure groceries ordered from Amazon and Whole \nFoods Market arrive in good condition, we look for ways to \nprotect products during delivery while still minimizing our \npackaging footprint.\n\nIn 2023, Amazon Fresh reduced our use of insulation \npackaging material, which avoided approximately 1,180 \nmetric tons of packaging. Similarly, Whole Foods Market \navoided 1,300 metric tons of packaging by using\u00a0daily \nvariable insulation, a practice that tracks and adjusts the \namount of insulation packaging used in deliveries in North \nAmerica to ensure it is used only when temperatures exceed \na specific threshold. \n\nGroceries are also being delivered in packaging that is easier \nto recycle. In 2023, the grocery delivery packaging used by \nAmazon Fresh was 88% recyclable by weight.\n\nWhole Foods Market published an updated version of \nits Packaging Guidelines in 2023 to help merchants, \nprocurement teams, and suppliers understand how to make \nmore sustainable choices for product packaging. In alignment \nwith the Whole Foods Market Sustainability Strategy, these \nguidelines are meant to reduce the amount of packaging it \nuses, improve the source material, and design for end-of-\nlife and lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Smarter \npackaging choices can also help reduce food waste and \ndivert packaging waste from landfills. Whole Foods Market\u2019s \nPackaging Guidelines are grounded in four core concepts (or \n\u201dPrinciples\u201c) aimed at balancing safety, performance, and \n\nsustainability: material safety, material performance and \nefficiency, design for recovery, and source responsibly.\n\nscientists continue to collaborate with others to accelerate \nthe innovation, deployment, and scaling of new lower-carbon \nand lower-waste materials.\n\nIncreasing the Recyclability of \nDevice Packaging\nAmazon\u2019s strategy to optimize and increase the recyclability \nof packaging extends to our devices.\u00a0In 2020, we set \nan ambitious goal to make our device packaging 100% \nrecyclable by 2023\u2014a first for the consumer electronics \nindustry. To work toward this goal, we collaborated with \nour suppliers to develop paper-based wraps and films that \nprotect devices and are compatible with paper recycling \nstreams. These paper-based wraps are recyclable in the U.S. \nwhere recycling programs are available.\n\nIn 2023, 90% of our new devices and accessories launched \nwith packaging that is 100% recyclable in the U.S., up from \n79% in 2022. We have made significant progress, but we \nhave not yet created recyclable packaging for heavier items, \nsuch as Fire TVs. The box for Fire TVs is recyclable, but we \nstill include foam cushioning and bags to protect the device \nwhen it is shipped, and these are not yet recyclable. Amazon \nremains committed to using recyclable device packaging and \nto inventing recyclable solutions for heavier items, such as \nFire TVs, that properly protect the device while maintaining \nour high bar for quality.\n\nPartnerships to Improve \nPackaging Materials, Circularity, \nand Recycling\nAmazon works hard to reduce plastic packaging across our \ndeliveries. However, in some cases, the right technologies and \nmaterials do not yet exist to adequately protect orders from \nphysical damage or in specific weather conditions. To find \nalternatives that are waterproof, flexible, and safe enough \nfor e-commerce deliveries and product packaging, our \n\nUnited States\n\nWe partner with industry peers and expert organizations, \nsuch as the Sustainable Packaging Coalition, to improve \nrecycling infrastructure. Amazon also works with The \nRecycling Partnership (TRP) to help launch\u00a0recycling \nprograms in communities across the U.S. Our 2023 \ninvestment helped TRP start recycling programs that reached \nmore than 36,000 households and recycled\u00a01\u00a0million pounds \nof materials.\n\nGlobal\n\nTogether with Novamont, an Italy-based biomaterials \ncompany, Amazon is testing new ways to collect and recycle \nbio-based and biodegradable materials, such as non-\ngenetically modified corn starch and vegetable oils. We \nco-invented an innovative recycling technology with the \nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory through the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy\u2019s BOTTLE Consortium, creating an \nentirely circular loop for these materials.18 In 2023, we piloted \nthis solution in Italy and Spain and plan to use the learnings \nto improve the technology for future use. \n\nWe also joined the Global Organization for PHA (GO!PHA) \nin 2023. This coalition is working to drive the transition to \na circular economy in which pollution-free alternatives to \nplastic are used in materials for packaging, single-use, and \ndurable applications. Amazon contributes to various GO!PHA \nworking groups, including Science & Technology and Policy, \nand collaborates on policy advocacy efforts.\n\nIn 2022, we became a member of the Australian Packaging \nCovenant Organisation (APCO), a nonprofit group leading \nthe development of a circular economy for packaging in \nAustralia. Along with setting the country\u2019s 2025 national \npackaging targets, APCO works to foster a collaborative \npackaging value chain in Australia.\n\nWe support the European Commission\u2019s goal to tackle \nexcessive packaging via legislation such as the EU Packaging \nand Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR). In Europe, we \ncontinue to improve our packaging using a science-based \napproach and will further reduce our environmental impact \nby investing in new materials, processes, and technologies \nthat drive void and materials reduction at scale.\n\nLooking Forward\nWe remain committed to enhancing our packaging for both \nperformance and sustainability. We will continue working to \nreduce our packaging footprint by increasing uptake of the \nShips in Product Packaging program, leveraging machine \nlearning and other innovative technologies to optimize \npackaging size and shape, and transitioning to more circular \npackaging materials instead of single-use plastics. In fact, in \nFebruary 2024, we announced that nearly 50% of customer \norders from our India fulfillment network now come \nwith reduced or no added packaging\u00a0\nprioritizing our engagement with selling partners and larger-\nscale coalitions to accelerate collective progress. \n\n.

It moves \nfrom the most preferred option at the top to the least \npreferred at the bottom. Materials in this hierarchy may \nbe recycled, reclaimed, or otherwise reused in some \nway and thus may not end up as waste in landfills. \nWe use this framework to better manage our waste, \npursuing\u00a0opportunities that are more preferred before \nmoving down the hierarchy.\n\nOur Approach\n\nOur waste\u00a0hierarchy sets out our guiding principles for \npreventing, managing, and reducing waste. Amazon has \nprograms in place to optimize our inventory, reduce food \nsurplus, and source materials that help us prevent waste in \nthe first place. Where possible, we look for ways to reduce, \nreuse, recycle, or compost\u00a0these materials.\n\nWe work hard to make it easy for customers to discover \nproducts they love. They usually do, but just like with any \nretailer, sometimes customers want to return something \nthat they purchased from us.\u00a0If customers do need to \nreturn something, Amazon strives to give items a second \nlife through resale, donation, or recycling\u2014in that order of \npriority. Returned items undergo inspection to determine \nwhether they can be resold. We aim to donate items that \ncannot be sold, but when they are not suitable for sale, \nresale, or donation, often due to damage or expiration, we \nprioritize their recycling. \n\nWe amplify our efforts by considering how customers use \nour products through end-of-life and by providing them \nwith opportunities to repair or resell products. Our circular \napproach keeps valuable resources in use longer, avoiding \nwaste and reducing related effects such as carbon emissions \nand pollution. \n\nWe know that avoiding waste is an ongoing process and \nthat we cannot do it on our own. We engage with suppliers \nto reduce waste related to our products, partner with other \norganizations to scale our efforts to transition to a more \ncircular economy, and work with local municipalities to \nimprove recycling infrastructure where we can. \n\nPrevent\nWe improve product and packaging design, inventory management, materials \nsourcing, and resource use to prevent waste from the start. \n\nReduce\nWe pursue avenues such as increased product durability and resale to reduce waste. \nWe also work to prevent waste generation by helping customers make informed \ndecisions, which reduces product returns, and offer several ways for them to \nsupport product circularity.\n\nReuse\nWe repair, repurpose, and donate usable items where possible.\n\nRecycle\nWe recycle and compost to recover raw materials where possible, including  \nfood waste.\n\nIncineration with Energy Recovery\nWhere prevention, reduction, reuse, or recycling are not possible, we target \nenergy recovery.\n\nLandfill and Incineration without Energy Recovery\nBoth landfill and incineration without energy recovery are disposal methods \nstrictly used as a last resort for waste that is either ineligible\u00a0for or cannot be \ndiverted to better recovery pathways.22\n\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue ChainWaste and CircularityPackagingCarbon-Free EnergyCarbonWater\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n36\n\nPreventing and Managing Waste\nThe waste we generate falls into two categories: internal and \nexternal. Internal waste is generated inside our operations, \nwhile external waste is generated both upstream and \ndownstream of our operations, such as by suppliers and \ncustomers. Some of these items are diverted from waste \nstreams by our prevention efforts, recycling programs, and \nother initiatives to reduce waste.\n\nOur internal (direct) waste footprint includes:\n\n\u2022  Operations: Operational waste is the type of waste that \n\nwe can most directly control. We manage operational \nwaste generated across our business, including from \nour grocery stores and other retail sites, customer \nfulfillment operations, office buildings, and data centers. \nWaste from our internal operations falls into two \ncategories: \n\u2022  Inventory waste includes heavily damaged and \nunsold items, customer returns that cannot be \nresold, donated, or recycled, and food that is no \nlonger safe for consumption.\n\n\u2022  Noninventory waste is made up of resources that \n\nare used and discarded within our businesses. These \nmaterials enable our operations but are not directly \npart of the inventory of finished goods or materials \nused to produce them. Noninventory waste includes \nmaterials such as used cardboard boxes, shrink wrap, \nelectronic waste, break room waste, used office \nfurniture, and damaged storage equipment.\n\nOur external (indirect) waste footprint includes the \nfollowing\u00a0areas:\n\n\u2022  Customer waste is generated during product use or in \nthe form of product and delivery packaging, including \nwhen disposed of. Beyond the work we do to help \ncustomers keep items in use longer, we also offer \nseveral ways for them to support product circularity \nand prevent\u00a0waste through our Amazon Second Chance \nprogram.\n\n\u2022  Construction waste comes from activities related \n\nto building our facilities. This consists mainly of \ncommingled construction and demolition waste such as \nmetals, masonry, asphalt, and drywall.\n\n\u2022  Supply chain\u00a0waste\u00a0is generated by third-party suppliers \n\nwho manufacture products for, and provide goods and \nservices to, our company.\n\nIn November 2023, we opened a pop-up Second Chance Store in London, \nwhere customers could shop second-hand products from Amazon.\n\nOur Progress\n\nIn 2023, we improved our ability to gather accurate, timely, \nand robust data. This allows us to enhance waste tracking \nand management as our business changes and as we add \nnew sites and onboard waste vendors. One enabler of this \nprogress was the creation of a central data collection tool \nthat provides a single, companywide repository for internal \nwaste data from our operations and activities. We also built a \nprototype forecasting tool to help us predict and plan for the \nfuture. We will continue to build these processes and tools \nthroughout 2024.\n\nFood Waste\nIn the U.S., nearly 98% of\u00a0Amazon\u2019s food handled goes \nto human and animal consumption, and in Europe, more \nthan 99%\u00a0does. While these figures are encouraging, we \nare always exploring new ways to reduce food loss and \nwaste as we work toward our goal to reduce our food waste \nby 50% across our U.S. and Europe operations by 2030. \nThis commitment is reflective of our membership in the \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Food Loss and \n, which we joined in 2020. We \nWaste 2030 Champions\u00a0\nthen extended our commitment to reducing food waste to \nour Europe operations in 2021.\u00a0We measure our progress \nagainst this commitment with a food waste intensity \nmetric that calculates the amount of food waste generated \nas a percentage of total food handled by weight within \nAmazon. As of December 2023, our food waste intensity \nhad decreased by 28% in the U.S. and by 75% in Europe \ncompared to a 2021 baseline.\n\nTo reduce food waste, we are improving our management \nand distribution channels and buying practices to minimize \nsurplus food inventory. In 2023, we enhanced buying and \n\ndistribution channels for Amazon sites in the U.S. and \nEurope. We also work to reduce our surplus by offering \ndiscounts on items at risk of becoming waste. In 2023, we \ncontinued to improve our food-discounting technology so \nmore food items are sold to customers. Amazon Fresh online \nlaunched a program in the UK, Germany, Spain, and Italy to \nsell items with reduced shelf life at a discount. On average, \n65% of that discounted inventory ends up in the hands of \ncustomers. A similar program exists for Amazon Fresh stores \nin the U.S. Programs like these not only help our customers \nfind food items at a lower price, but also contribute to our \nambition to reduce food waste. We also donate surplus food \nitems to local food banks and food rescue organizations. \n\nLearn more about how we are donating surplus food items \nto those who need them most\u00a0\n\nWhere food waste is not preventable, we are working to keep \nit out of landfills. As of the end of 2023,\u00a062\u00a0Amazon Fresh \nstores in the U.S. and Europe divert food waste to organic \nrecycling services, including those that support composting \nor anaerobic digestion. In 2023, 452 Whole Foods Market \nlocations had active organics diversion programs, which \ndiverted over 87,000 tons of food waste from landfill. \n\nWe also advocate for policies that would help prevent \nusable food from being wasted. In 2023, Amazon and Whole \nFoods Market supported the U.S. Food Date Labeling Act \nbecause confusion around food expiration date labeling \ncan result in usable food being unnecessarily thrown out. \nOur engagement included advocating to Congress for \nstandardizing and clarifying expiration date labels on food \nas part of a coalition led by the World Wildlife Fund and the \nZero Food Waste Coalition.\n\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue ChainWaste and CircularityPackagingCarbon-Free EnergyCarbonWater\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n37\n\nUnlocking New Insights through \nContinuous Learning\n\nAs we continue on our journey to reduce waste\u2014\nincluding our commitment to reduce food waste \nby 50% in our U.S. and Europe operations by \n2030\u2014we are exploring different ways to learn \nand grow. As of the end of 2023, four Amazon \nFresh facilities had achieved UL\u2019s Zero Waste to \nLandfill certification at Silver or Gold level.\n\nWe secured this certification by improving \noperational waste sorting processes, standardizing \nrecycling practices at all sites, introducing new \nassociate trainings, and establishing new diversion \npathways, including for food waste. Through the \ncertification process, we learned new ways of \nworking and identified potential opportunities for \nAmazon. We are excited to leverage what we have \nlearned to improve our overall waste footprint.\n\nReducing and Managing Inventory \nand Customer Waste \nPrevent\u00a0\nWhen it comes to product inventory, our priority is to \nprevent waste, both by helping customers make more \ninformed shopping decisions\u2014which helps reduce customer \nreturns\u2014and by reducing the number of products damaged \nin handling. \n\nReducing customer returns:\u00a0We want our customers to be \nable to use the product they ordered with the quality level \nthey expect. Our Product Lifecycle Support (PLS) program \nprovides support options for customers to get the most out \n\nof their purchase for eligible products. As of the end of 2023, \nAmazon\u2019s PLS program offered three free post-purchase \ncare options: original equipment manufacturer (OEM) \nsupport and OEM repair, where customers can go straight \nto the manufacturer for support; Self Service, which helps \ncustomers address issues themselves; and parts replacement, \nwhere customers can request available components to \nreplace damaged or missing parts, free of charge. In 2023, \nthe PLS program helped avoid the return of more than 11 \nmillion items in the U.S. and Europe, up 50% from 2022. \nAmazon Private Brands also launched a spare parts and \nrepair program in Europe in 2023.\n\nWe have learned that customers are more likely to keep an \napparel item when a size is recommended for them. That \nis why we developed a deep learning-based algorithm to \nrecommend, in real time, the best-fitting size for a customer. \nIn 2023, our size recommendation system analyzed over \n500\u00a0million\u00a0data points every day and generated nearly \n3\u00a0billion size recommendations each month for millions of \ncustomers across 19 countries around the world, including \nthe U.S., India, and the UK.\n\nLearn more about our artificial intelligence (AI)-driven \nsize\u00a0recommendations\u00a0\n\nReducing damage:\u00a0We work hard to ensure our customers do \nnot receive products that have been damaged in handling or \nduring transportation. In 2023, we established a specialized \nteam to analyze instances of damage across our global \nwarehouse operations. Analyzing this data at a global level \nidentified opportunities to implement technology and \nprocess changes to reduce damages. The resulting\u00a0global \nwarehouse damage-reduction plan led to a 21% decrease \nin damage\u00a0intensity (how many products are damaged for \nevery product we handle) worldwide in 2023. \n\nReduce and Reuse\n\nWhere possible, we give inventory a second life. We repair \nor resell items whenever possible and help our sellers do \nthe\u00a0same. \n\nReducing overstock:\u00a0Before we remove overstock from \nour inventory, we try to sell it at a deep discount on our \nAmazon Outlet storefront. When we cannot sell these items, \ninventory is returned to vendors or sold to wholesalers to be \noffered on secondary markets.\n\nRepair and resell: We carefully inspect and evaluate all \nreturned and undelivered items at our Amazon return \ncenters. If returned items meet Amazon\u2019s high bar for sale as \nnew, we re-list them. \n\nFor items that are not eligible for re-listing as new but meet \nAmazon\u2019s standards to be sold as used, we (or our specialized \nrepair vendors) test, clean, repair, and repackage them prior \nto re-listing the item for sale. We continue to expand our \nrepair capabilities, repairing 24% more products worldwide \nin 2023 than in 2022. Amazon customers viewing items listed \nfor sale as used will see a condition (e.g., Like New, Very \nGood, Good, Acceptable) and reason(s) for the condition (e.g., \nmissing a user manual, cosmetic damage), allowing them to \nmake the appropriate purchasing decision. \n\nLearn more about how Amazon manages returns\u00a0\n\nAmazon Second Chance: Our Amazon Second Chance \nprogram helps customers give their items a second life. For \nexample, Amazon Trade-In lets customers trade in thousands \nof qualifying Amazon or non-Amazon devices in the U.S., the \nUK, and Germany for a gift card or promotional discount. \nWhen customers buy a pre-owned device, it extends that \nitem\u2019s life, reducing e-waste and raw material extraction. In \n2023, customers traded in over 1 million\u00a0devices. Amazon \ndevices that are traded in by customers are evaluated to \ndetermine their condition. Some undergo refurbishment, \nand those that meet our quality bar for resale may be sold as \nAmazon Certified Refurbished devices\u00a0\nAmazon Warehouse\u00a0\n\n or as used through \n\n.\n\nLearn more about Amazon Trade-In\u00a0\n\nAmazon Second Chance Store\n\nIn November 2023, Amazon opened a pop-up \nSecond Chance Store in central London, where \nshoppers could buy quality returned, refurbished, \nand open-box items in-person. More than 6,500 \nshoppers visited our store, browsing for kitchen \nand household appliances, books, games and toys, \nelectronics, and more. While the physical Second \nChance Store was temporary, customers can \nbenefit from our Second Chance program online \nyear-round.\n\nReCommerce for Amazon sellers:\u00a0When returned\u00a0items \nare not eligible for resale as new or used, those items \nare returned to sellers, liquidated, donated, or recycled. \nReCommerce is the selling of previously owned items \nto buyers who reuse, recycle, or resell them. We provide \nReCommerce services to Amazon sellers by grading their \nreturned items and enabling recovery through programs \nsuch as grade and resell, liquidation, or donation. In \n2023, we\u00a0helped sellers resell, liquidate, or donate nearly \n368\u00a0million of their items in the U.S. and Europe, a 42% \nincrease compared to 2022.\n\nDonation: We donate items that are safe to use but remain \nin our inventory after we try to reuse, resell, or repair them. \nIn 2023, we donated or helped our sellers donate over \n162\u00a0million items worldwide.\n\nRecycle\n\nInventory that is not resold or donated may still be used, \nreused, or reclaimed through our inventory recycling \nprogram. We leverage existing recycling streams where \npossible and work closely with recycling partners to find \n\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue ChainWaste and CircularityPackagingCarbon-Free EnergyCarbonWater\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n38\n\nways to recycle new types of materials. The result of \nsuccessfully using, reusing, or reclaiming inventory via our \nrecycling program is diversion of these inventory items from \nlandfills and incineration.  \n\nIf a customer\u2019s device is not eligible for our Amazon Trade-\nIn program, the Amazon Recycling Program provides the \ncustomer with a shipping label to send their device to be \nrecycled and safely disposed of at a licensed recycling facility.\n\nReducing and Managing \nNoninventory Waste \nNoninventory waste is made up of the materials we use \nto run our businesses, including cardboard packaging, \nshipping pallets, plastic stretch film, and paper labels. Our \ngoal is to segregate these materials as much as possible so \nthey can be more easily recycled. Cardboard is one of our \nlargest noninventory waste streams, so we work closely \nwith third-party recycling partners, including the companies \nthat we source our cardboard packaging from, to recycle \nthese\u00a0materials. \n\nIn 2023, we:\n\n\u2022  Improved our ability to collect and consolidate \n\nwaste data from our vendors. This gives us a better \nunderstanding of our footprint and has allowed us to \nidentify opportunities to increase waste diversion rates \nacross our complex business. \n\n\u2022  Increased our rate of operational waste diverted from \n\ndisposal, placing emphasis on recycling and composting.\n\n\u2022  Expanded our recycling efforts to include hard-to-\n\nrecycle materials such as adhesive label backing, bulk \ncargo bags, and even personal protective equipment \n(such as masks and gloves).\n\n\u2022  Replaced single-use cardboard shipping containers with \n\nreusable outbound carts to reduce cardboard waste at \ncertain sites.\n\nLearn more about our partnerships to improve recycling\u00a0\n\nAWS Circular Economy\nAWS embraces circular economy principles for its server \nracks by designing reusable and lower-carbon rack systems \nfrom the outset. In addition, AWS works to keep equipment \noperating efficiently and to recover value from securely \ndecommissioned equipment through reuse, repair, and \nrecycling. By working to maximize resource value for as long \nas possible, AWS reduces waste generation from its global \noperations, decreases the use of raw materials, and reduces \ncarbon emissions across its supply chain. \n\nDesign Better\n\nFor its server racks, AWS concentrates on avoiding excess \nmaterial such as steel or plastic, increasing recycled and bio-\nbased content, and planning for repair, reuse, and recycling \nfrom the beginning. AWS has worked with suppliers to \nrequire that plastic parts of server racks launched since July \n2023\u00a0contain at least 30% recycled or bio-based plastic. In \n2023, AWS began to transition to plastic containing recycled \nand bio-based content in parts including air ducts, power \ndistribution board covers, card holders, solid state drive (SSD) \ncarriers/cages, riser brackets, latches, and trays. The carbon \nfootprint of these plastic parts is\u00a0up to 14% lower than that \nof older platforms with only virgin content. AWS is also \nworking to use steel from electric arc furnaces, which use \nscrap steel in rack enclosures, increasing the recycled content \nfrom 10% to 90%. \n\nOperate Longer\n\nWhen AWS uses equipment for as long as operationally \nefficient, it reduces the carbon footprint associated with \nmanufacturing and using new hardware and avoids \nunnecessary waste. In February 2024, AWS announced \nthat the average expected server lifetime had\u00a0improved \nfrom five to six years.\u00a0AWS also successfully completed a \nproof of concept that extends the lifespan of S3 hard disk \ndrives (HDDs) by up to two years. This program consolidates \nindividual functional drives from multiple aging racks \ninto fewer, fully functional racks (see the figure, right, on \n\nhard drive consolidation). This consolidation means AWS \nmoves from powering and cooling a greater number of \naging racks to fewer racks with optimized utility, saving \nwater and energy. Additionally, as a result of consolidation, \nAWS sends only the broken drives for recycling, avoiding \nearly retirement of healthy and working hard drives on \nthe same rack. AWS sends the decommissioned rack to a \nreverse logistics hub for reuse assessment. In 2023, this \nprogram prevented the purchase of over 8,100 new hard \ndrives, avoiding associated carbon emissions and costs while \nalso increasing capacity efficiency. This program is now \noperational and AWS expects it to grow, avoiding even more \ncarbon emissions in the\u00a0future. \n\nRecover More\n\nWhen it is time for server racks to be decommissioned, AWS \nremoves all customer data through secure and thorough \nsanitation processes. AWS then sends retired infrastructure \nhardware from around the world to its regional reverse \nlogistics hubs. These hubs help AWS consolidate, assess, \nrepair, and recirculate functional equipment back into its \n\ninventory or to third parties to be sold for reuse.\u00a0They also \nenable AWS to optimize component reuse across its data \ncenters, taking decommissioned equipment from one facility \nand redeploying it to serve demand elsewhere. In 2023, \nAWS expanded its reverse logistics global square footage \nand capacity by making investments in three additional \nsites located in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. The added \nscale and enhanced capabilities provide global coverage \nfor AWS\u2019s decommissioned server and network hardware \nto be tested, repaired, reused, or recycled. As a result, in \n2023,\u00a014.6\u00a0million\u00a0hardware components were diverted from \nlandfills by being recycled or sold into the secondary market \nfor reuse.\n\nConstruction and Demolition \nWaste\nTo reduce construction and demolition waste from building \nprojects, we leverage our design standards to optimize the \namount of building materials we need. Where possible, we \n\nAWS Hard Drive Consolidation\n\n1\n\nBroken drives are identified and sent \nto recycling.\n\n2\n\nFunctioning drives are consolidated \ninto fewer racks, which prevents waste \ngeneration and displaces energy and \nmaterials use with new drives.\n\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue ChainWaste and CircularityPackagingCarbon-Free EnergyCarbonWater\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n39\n\nreuse items such as furniture to reduce our waste generation \nat the decommissioning stage.

For example, our devices teams \nengage suppliers to decrease waste and material use as part \nof our work to encourage more efficient manufacturing.\u00a0As \nof 2023,\u00a042\u00a0supplier sites of Amazon devices had achieved \nUL\u2019s Zero Waste to Landfill certification\u00a0at Silver or better, \nan increase from 10 supplier sites when we first launched \nthe program in 2021.\u00a0All final assembly sites worldwide and \nall China-based packaging sites\u00a0for Echo, Kindle, Fire tablet, \nFire TV devices, cables, and adapters\u00a0have also secured Zero \nWaste to Landfill certification at Silver or better.\n\nLearn more about our efforts to improve the sustainability \nof our devices\u00a0\n\nPartnering for Circularity\nWe cannot solve all the challenges that underpin the broader \nshift to a circular economy alone, so we are working with \nmultiple industry partners to innovate and bring about \nchange at scale. \n\nIn 2023, we expanded our collaboration with the Ellen \nMacArthur Foundation to drive scalable, industry-wide \nsolutions for a circular economy. As a Strategic Partner of \n\nresourced governments. In many countries, PIC documents \nare mainly transmitted by post, fax, and email. We are \nworking with other industry stakeholders and international \nnongovernmental organizations to develop an electronic PIC \npilot project in the Asia-Pacific region. An expedited, reliable \nPIC process would allow controlled wastes to move more \nefficiently to countries with capacity for environmentally \nsound management of waste and maximum resource \nrecovery potential. \u00a0\n\nAdditionally, we supported industry efforts to maintain a \nclear framework for distinguishing between cross-border \nshipments of waste electrical and electronic equipment \n(WEEE) and used electrical and electronic equipment \n(UEEE). This will protect flows of valuable UEEE to and from \ncountries with the capacity to extend the life of products and \npromote product reuse.\n\nLooking Forward\nReducing waste across Amazon is an ongoing journey. We \nwill strive to advance our work across our waste hierarchy to \nprevent\u00a0waste, and we\u2019ll continue scaling waste reduction \nand product circularity programs. Doing so in a manner that \ncan keep up with the pace at which resource use is growing \nwill require adopting new technologies that enable us to \nmake progress more quickly and at a larger scale. In 2024, \nThe Climate Pledge Fund invested in Glacier\u00a0\n\u200a, a company \nusing AI-powered robots to automate the sorting of \nrecyclables and collect real-time data on recycling streams. \nThis technology helps recycling centers sort materials more \neffectively so that recyclable items stay out of landfills. We \nare also excited to collaborate with Glacier on a pilot project \nto sort novel biomaterials, which would enable recycling for \nmaterials that currently cannot be reused. \n\nthe Ellen MacArthur Foundation Network, which is dedicated \nto creating a circular economy, we work to leverage our \nreach, technology, and innovation capabilities and the \nfoundation\u2019s subject-matter expertise to launch and scale \ncircular economy solutions. This collaboration focuses on \ncertifications for products with circular features,\u00a0providing \ncustomers with the information they need to make more \ncircular choices.

Our global water use includes water used \nin both our direct operations and wider supply chain. \n\nWithin our direct operations, we use water in the \nfollowing\u00a0ways:\n\n\u2022  AWS data centers:\u00a0Water is an essential resource for \n\nAWS. AWS primarily uses it to cool its global data \ncenters, which give customers continuous access to AWS \ntechnologies. As a leader in water use effectiveness \n(WUE) among cloud providers, AWS aims to do its part \nto help solve water scarcity challenges. That is why \nit has set a goal to become water positive by 2030, \nmeaning it will return more water to communities and \nthe environment than its direct operations use. Through \nthis goal, AWS is focused on reducing overall water \nwithdrawal and replenishing water in basins facing water \nscarcity located in communities around data centers.\n\u2022  Water use and replenishment across Amazon: For \n\nother water-intensive Amazon facilities, including \nlogistics, grocery, and corporate office sites, we \nconcentrate abatement efforts on regions with the \nhighest risk of water scarcity based on their climates \nand watershed conditions. Our logistics buildings \n(fulfillment centers, sort centers, and delivery stations) \nand corporate offices use water in break rooms, kitchens, \nbathrooms, and for landscape irrigation. Our grocery \nstores (Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods Market) also \nuse water for these purposes, as well as to cook, clean, \nand defrost food; in water refill stations; and as ice in \nproduct displays.\n\nWe\u00a0track our progress by measuring and analyzing our direct \noperational water footprint. Since our different businesses \nuse water in different ways, and water risk varies significantly \nacross geographies, the aim of our data insights is to design \na water program that we can tailor to specific needs across \nour company. This enables us to better forecast future \nwater demand, determine the best ways to conserve water, \nand create more efficient systems that will benefit local \nwatersheds over\u00a0time.\n\nWater Risk Assessment\nIn 2023, Amazon conducted an in-depth, site-level global \nwater risk assessment of our retail, operations, and corporate \nbuildings to determine which regions to prioritize for \nintervention. We ranked regions by looking at their intrinsic \nwater scarcity based on hazards such as water stress, \ngroundwater table decline, and variability of water supply. \nAdditionally, we examined the exposure and vulnerability of \nour operations and communities to those hazards, looking \nat factors such as the density and occupancy of our sites, \namount of fresh water we withdraw, social vulnerability of \nlocal populations, and general ability of our operations to \nadapt to water shortage events. We used this assessment to \nbuild a water risk dashboard, which enables us to identify \npriority\u00a0regions and sites for water stewardship projects.\n\nOur Progress\n\nWater Positive in Data Centers\nIn 2022, AWS announced its commitment to being water \npositive by 2030. To meet this goal, AWS is delivering on \nfour\u00a0strategies:\n\n\u2022  Water use effectiveness: AWS is continually working to \noptimize its water consumption and aims to improve its \noverall WUE by reducing how much incoming water it \nuses. AWS uses cloud technologies such as Internet of \nThings (IoT) to analyze real-time water use and identify \nleaks.\n\n\u2022  Using more\u00a0sustainable sources: AWS strives to use \nsustainable\u00a0water sources, such as recycled water and \nharvested rainwater, where possible.

These projects expand community water \naccess, availability, and quality by restoring watersheds \nand bringing clean water, sanitation, and hygiene \nservices to water-stressed communities.\n\nAt the end of 2023, AWS was\u00a041% of the way toward \nachieving its water positive goal.\u00a0AWS measures progress \nagainst this goal annually by adding together reused \nwater and water from replenishment projects and dividing \nthat number by total water withdrawal minus water from \nsustainable sources. \n\nIn addition to reporting overall progress, AWS measures \nand tracks two other important water metrics: WUE for \nits data centers and the number of projects contributing \nto its water positive goal. At the end of 2023, AWS had 15 \nreplenishment projects in 10 countries and 26\u00a0data centers \nusing more\u00a0sustainable water sources.\n\nIn 2023, AWS used its water footprint analysis to inform \nwhere and how it can use more sustainable water sources \n(including recycled water and harvested rainwater), \nimprove WUE, expand water reuse, and grow water \nreplenishment\u00a0investments. \n\nAWS works toward its water positive goal through cross-\nteam collaboration, with input from civil and environmental \nengineers, data center operations specialists, and water \nstewardship experts.\n\nLearn more about how AWS calculates its progress using its \nWater Positive Methodology\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nWater Use Effectiveness\n\nAWS minimizes water use by using real-time data to identify \nleaks, piloting new treatment technologies, and exploring a \nrange of operational changes, such as installing sensors and \nalerts to track water use and detect anomalies.\u00a0\n\nGlobal teams deploy water monitoring technology in AWS \ndata centers to determine where they need to take action to \nmaintain or improve WUE. In 2023, AWS installed thousands \nof sensors in its data centers to track water use. Automatic \nalerts inform AWS of any anomalies so that operators can \ninvestigate in near-real time.

AWS uses recycled water for cooling, \nwhich helps preserve drinking water for local communities. \n\nIn 2023, AWS increased the number of data centers using \nrecycled water for cooling from\u00a020 to 24, including two data \ncenters in Virginia, one in California, and one in Singapore.\n\nAWS has additionally begun harvesting rainwater as a \nsustainable water source. Using rainwater minimizes \ndemands on community water resources and reduces \npotential surface water pollution from stormwater runoff.\u00a0In \nBrazil, two of its data centers collect rainwater, reducing how \nmuch potable water AWS needs for cooling.\n\nReusing Cooling Water in Communities\n\nAWS data centers circulate water through their cooling \nsystems as many times as possible, but eventually it needs to \nbe replaced with new water. While spent water can no longer \nbe used for cooling, it may be used for other purposes, such \nas irrigation. AWS is using advanced cloud services, such as \nIoT technologies, to analyze real-time water use, identify \n\nDelivering Water Replenishment\nBy the end of 2023, AWS had invested in 15 water \nreplenishment activities, returning water to the communities \nwhere it operates across 12 of our global infrastructure \nregions.25 These investments have expanded AWS \nreplenishment activities to three new countries, bringing the \ntotal to 10: Australia,\u00a0Brazil, India, Indonesia, Ireland, South \nAfrica, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the U.S.\u00a0These activities \nhelp recharge groundwater, build wetlands, improve water \nquality, and reduce water loss in utility systems. In 2023, \nAWS\u2019s water replenishment portfolio returned 3.5 billion \nliters to local communities.\n\nWatershed Restoration in Australia\nAWS is working with the Great Eastern Ranges (GER)\u2014a \nnongovernmental organization whose aim is to protect, \nconnect, and regenerate wildlife habitats across eastern \nAustralia\u2014to enhance the health and functioning of the \nmajor watershed serving Sydney. Catastrophic bushfires \nin late 2019 and early 2020 damaged large areas of \nthis watershed.\u00a0This joint project is restoring the local \nenvironment in key locations to improve water yield and \nquality, boost biodiversity, and enhance the resilience of \nlocal communities against the effects of climate change. \nTogether, AWS and GER have supported initiatives that are \nreducing polluted stormwater runoff, increasing groundwater \nrecharge, enhancing local biodiversity, and supporting \nwildlife, including 15 endangered species in the affected \narea. Once complete, the project is expected to deliver \nan additional 32\u00a0million liters of water each year to the \nSydney\u00a0watershed.\n\nTackling Water Leaks in Spain\u00a0\nSpain is considered one of the most water-stressed \nindustrialized countries in the world. It has experienced long-\nterm drought since 2022, driven in part by water loss from \naging infrastructure. To help address this, AWS worked with \n\nFIDO Tech, a cloud-based water leak detection company that \nuses AWS technology, to identify and reduce leakages in the \nwater system in Spain\u2019s Villanueva de G\u00e1llego community. \nThis municipality is located in the province of Zaragoza, \nAragon, between Barcelona and Madrid, where AWS data \ncenters are located.\n\nAcoustic sensors placed on water pipes and meters used \nFIDO\u2019s machine learning algorithm\u2014built on AWS\u2014to \nidentify the location and size of leaks so the community \ncould prioritize fixing the largest ones first.\n\nIn total, the sensors identified 21 leaks and other types of \nwater loss. By repairing the largest, highest-priority leaks \nfirst, the project is reducing water loss by an estimated 33 \nmillion liters per year.\n\nSupplying Water to Farmers in India and Indonesia\nTo improve access to water across India and Indonesia, \nAWS works with Water.org and WaterAid on a variety of \nprojects, such as microfinance loans, rainwater harvesting, \n\ngroundwater recharge, and piped water supply projects. For \nexample, loans have helped communities finance water pipe \nconnections and toilet installations in homes. Altogether, \nAWS\u2019s investments in Water.org and WaterAid initiatives have \nbenefited 290,000 people.\n\nIn 2023, AWS announced new projects with SEARCH, a \nnonprofit organization that enables marginalized groups \nin rural India to enhance their socioeconomic status. These \nprojects will help provide a consistent water supply to \nfarmers in villages surrounding Hyderabad, where AWS has \noperations, by rehabilitating existing water storage ponds \nand constructing new ones. Once complete, the ponds are \nexpected to deliver 86 million liters of water back to the \ncommunity each year and help increase agricultural output. \nThe ponds will also help recharge groundwater in an area \ndesignated as a semi-critical exploitation zone due to \noverpumping of its underlying aquifer. In 2023, SEARCH \nbegan a detailed community engagement process to ensure \nprojects are implemented to maximize benefits for\u00a0villagers. \n\nIn collaboration with the Washington Water Trust, AWS supported a drought relief program that enhances stream flows to help ensure \nhealthy salmon runs in the Dungeness River in Washington state\u2019s Olympic Peninsula.\n\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue ChainWaste and CircularityPackagingCarbon-Free EnergyCarbonWater\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n43\n\nWater Use and Replenishment \nacross Amazon\nIn addition to moving toward\u00a0our water positive goal for \nAWS, Amazon is scaling best practices for water stewardship \nacross our business more broadly. We strive to reduce water \nuse in our operations, which include logistics sites such as \nfulfillment centers, as well as in our corporate offices and \ngrocery stores. \n\nAcross our global logistics network, our teams actively look \nfor ways to conserve and reuse water. In 2023, we gathered \nrobust data to analyze how much water our facilities use and \ncreated a baseline for our water footprint to track progress \ngoing forward. We leveraged our water risk dashboard to \nmonitor water hazards and water-related business risks to \nprioritize improvements. To inform the investments we make \nin water infrastructure, we also performed cost-benefit \nanalyses for an array of water conservation, reuse, and \nharvesting projects. \n\nOperations\u00a0\n\nIn 2023, Amazon scaled water replenishment, harvesting, \nand reuse solutions across our operations in countries around \nthe world.\n\nIndia ranks at the top of our list of water-stressed regions, \nand our water stewardship efforts there reflect the urgent \nneed to take action.\u00a0In 2023, Amazon teams recharged local \naquifers with harvested rainwater, installed low-flow fixtures \nand waterless urinals, and built in-house sewage treatment \nplants to reuse wastewater for flushing and gardening. \nIn addition, these teams diverted runoff water from the \n\nrooftops of 53% of our fulfillment centers to return as much \nstormwater to the watershed as possible.\u00a0\n\nAcross the Middle East and Africa, we installed low-flow \nfixtures at our facilities. Our operations there additionally \nsaved an estimated 3,700 cubic meters of water by installing \naerators in faucets, shifting from conventional to sensor \nfaucets, reducing toilet flush tank capacity, and recirculating \nwater used in fire pump testing rather than draining it. In \nNorth America, we added faucet aerators in 90% of our \nfulfillment centers, sort centers, and grocery logistics sites.\n\nIn Japan, we added rainwater harvesting as a criterion for \nbuilt-to-standard fulfillment centers, which will become \nstandard for buildings opening after 2025. We expect \nto finish building the first fulfillment center with this \ninfrastructure in late 2024, with an official launch in July \n2025. By harvesting rainwater, we estimate that this site will \nreduce its water withdrawal by up to 40%.\n\nAlong with scaling water conservation, harvesting, and reuse \nsolutions, Amazon has seeded a global water metering and \nleak detection program, with pilots at logistics, grocery, \nand data center sites in the U.S. and Europe supported \nby Amazon-developed software. Using machine learning, \nthe program automatically sends a repair ticket to our \nengineering team when it detects abnormal water flows. \nOne pilot in the UK saved an estimated 700,000 cubic \nmeters of leaked water over two years (2022 and 2023) \nat 53\u00a0monitored sites. This work is providing valuable \ninformation about where failures occur within our water \npipelines. We aim to scale this project to additional sites \nin\u00a02024.\n\nCorporate Offices\n\nOur corporate offices increased water recycling and the use \nof low-flow fixtures in 2023. This work is part of our efforts \nto set new standards for design as we strive to reduce indoor \nwater use by more than\u00a030% globally versus a Leadership \nin Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) baseline. Our \noffices in India and China, for example, replaced existing \nwater flow fixtures in bathrooms and utilities areas with \nlow-flow fixtures, reducing water use by 16%, or more than \n15.6\u00a0million gallons, compared to a 2022 baseline.\n\nWater.org Water & Climate Fund\n\nIn 2022, Amazon announced a partnership with \nWater.org to help launch the Water.org Water & \nClimate Fund, which focuses on climate-resilient \nwater and sanitation solutions. Amazon\u2019s $10 million \ncontribution will directly empower 1 million people \nwith access to clean water by 2025, providing 3 \nbillion liters of water per year to areas facing water \nscarcity. \n\nAs part of Amazon\u2019s Water.org Water & Climate \nFund work, more than 400,000 people were \nconnected to piped water supply and sanitation \nsystems across India. The volume of fresh water \nsaved by operational efficiencies, replenished \nthrough groundwater recharge, and made \naccessible through our Water.org initiatives \ntogether accounted for 93% of the direct water \nfootprint of our logistics sites in India in 2023. \n\nLooking Forward\nTo build on progress made in 2023, we\u00a0will continue to \nanalyze our water footprint and water risk assessment \nin both\u00a0our direct operations and supply chain, as \nwell as develop a comprehensive water management \nstrategy tailored to unique geographic and business unit \nneeds.\u00a0AWS\u00a0will focus on making ongoing progress toward\u00a0its \nwater positive goal, investing in efforts to restore watersheds \nand increase access to water, sanitation, and hygiene for \npeople who need it most. Amazon plans to leverage the \nlearnings from this work, applying them companywide to \nstrengthen our efforts to conserve and reuse water across \nour operations, within our communities, and in water-scarce \nregions around the world.\n\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue ChainWaste and CircularityPackagingCarbon-Free EnergyCarbonWater\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n44\n\nValue Chain\n\nMillions of people work alongside Amazon to serve our customers, \nincluding our employees, partners, suppliers, and people living in the \ncommunities where we operate.

Just as we are committed to \npromoting the rights of our employees, we are committed \nto working with our suppliers to embed respect for human \nrights in their operations and supply chains and to help \nus further our goal to support the fundamental dignity of \neveryone we work with.\n\nWe take pride in our long-standing dedication and \ncommitment to human rights. While we continue to make \nprogress, we know that this work is ongoing, and there \nis always more to be done. We are constantly learning \nand making improvements to our policies, programs, and \neducational resources to help ensure that our employees and \nworkers everywhere we operate are treated with respect, \nknow their rights, and can safely speak up if they encounter \nrisks at work.\n\nOur human rights strategy\u00a0is informed by leading \ninternational\u00a0standards and frameworks developed by \nthe United Nations (UN) and the International Labour \nOrganization (ILO). Amazon is committed to respecting and \nsupporting the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business \nand Human Rights (UNGPs)\u00a0 \u2009\u2009, the UN Universal Declaration \nof Human Rights\u00a0\n, and  \nthe ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights \nat Work\u00a0\n\n, the Core Conventions of the ILO\u00a0\n\n. \n\nOur Progress\n\nOur strategy to deliver on these commitments is based on \nthe UNGPs and has five pillars:\n\n\u2022  Develop and maintain strong policies and \n\nstandards:\u00a0Our policies and standards are the backbone \nof our human rights strategy, spanning a diverse array of \npeople-centric topics.\u00a0\n\n\u2022  Embed human rights into our business operations \n\nand decision-making:\u00a0We are committed to embedding \nhuman rights considerations into decision-making \nacross our business and into our policy and governance \nframework, including by raising awareness among our \nemployees on human rights issues through education \nand trainings.\n\n\u2022  Assess, prioritize, and address risk:\u00a0We have robust \n\nprocesses that allow us to effectively identify, prioritize, \nand ultimately address human rights risks across our \nbusiness and supply chain.\n\n\u2022  Engage with stakeholders: We are committed to \n\ndriving best practices in human rights due diligence \nby expanding our stakeholder engagement. Through \ncollaboration with stakeholders including supply chain \nworkers, employees and contractors, customers, and \ncommunities, we are creating effective, sustainable \nsolutions that put people first.\n\n\u2022  Improve access to effective grievance mechanisms \nand remediation:\u00a0We offer multiple channels for our \nemployees to voice grievances and concerns. We work \nhard to raise employee awareness of these grievance \nmechanisms and engage with suppliers to do the same \nfor their workers.\u00a0\n\nRespecting human rights is critical to Amazon\u2019s broader \nsustainability efforts and an area that requires ongoing, \nactive work across each of our strategic pillars. In 2023, we \nmaintained our focus on existing programs and embarked \non new work and partnerships to continue delivering on \nour\u00a0commitments.\n\nDeveloping and Maintaining \nStrong Policies and Standards\nAmazon\u2019s human rights strategy is anchored in policies that \napply across our business. We regularly review our strategy, \nprinciples, and supporting policies to identify opportunities \nfor improvement. By engaging external stakeholders \nand monitoring evolving international and human rights \nstandards, regulations, and industry best practices, we \nare able to effectively and continuously improve our own \npolicies and standards to better support our employees \nand\u00a0suppliers. \n\n demonstrate our \n\nOur Global Human Rights Principles\u00a0\ncommitment to respecting fundamental human rights and \nthe dignity of people connected to our business around the \nworld.

We have a centralized team of experts \nwho work across the company to conduct human rights \nand environmental due diligence. With support from this \nteam, Amazon businesses work toward integrating our \nhuman rights principles into their operations and business \nrelationships by conducting human rights risk assessments \nand remedying identified issues.\n\nIn our supply chains, we assess and respond to risk by \nleveraging internal and external data and guidance from \nstakeholders, including industry experts, civil society groups, \nand nongovernmental organizations. We also engage directly \nwith suppliers and their workers and conduct independent \naudits to verify compliance with our Supply Chain Standards. \nWe work with suppliers on appropriate remediation measures \nand offer partnerships and programs to help them address \nrisks and invest in worker well-being. Our supply chain \nefforts focus on six priority commitment areas: Safe and \nHealthy Workplaces, Gender Equity, Fair Wages, Responsible \nRecruitment and Freely Chosen Employment, Environmental \nProtection, and Access to Effective Grievance Mechanisms.\n\nLearn more about our supply chain due diligence work\u00a0\n\nWe understand that as our supply chain evolves, expanding \ninto new geographies and areas of business, so too do the \nrisks we face. We\u2019re committed to growing and adapting our \nwork to meet these challenges\u2014and helping others do so \nas\u00a0well.\n\nHuman Rights Assessments\n\nIdentifying and prioritizing the most salient risks connected \nto Amazon operations and business relationships is \ncentral to our human rights due diligence practices.26 As \nwe continuously improve and expand these practices, we \nuse human rights assessment methodologies to identify \nand mitigate human rights risks. These assessments help \nus understand the causes of systemic issues, enhance \nongoing engagement with critical stakeholders, implement \nthe correct risk-based mitigation measures, and refine \nstrategies for ongoing risk management across our \nsupply chain. Examples of human rights assessment \nmethodologies\u00a0include:\n\n\u2022  Human rights saliency assessments, which focus risk \n\nmanagement action and remediation on the most severe \nrisks relevant to a company\u2019s business activity.\n\n\u2022  Human rights impact assessments (HRIAs), which \nexamine a particular business segment or product, a \ncountry of operation or sourcing, a potentially affected \ngroup, or other human rights risk areas for a specific \nsubset of a business.\n\n\u2022  Human rights due diligence management assessments, \n\nwhich analyze a business\u2019s internal capacity to assess \nand respond to human rights risks. \n\nIn 2020, we worked with Article One, a business and human \nrights consulting firm, to complete an enterprise-wide \nhuman rights saliency assessment. Through this assessment, \nwe identified nine\u00a0salient human rights risks across our \noperations and business relationships. That same year, we \nalso initiated a business-level HRIA with Amazon Devices\u00a0\n\n. \n\nEach year, we expand on our commitment to conduct \nbusiness-specific human rights assessments, ensuring we \nare always raising the bar on how we evaluate and respond \nto risks across our operations and supply chain. These \nassessments allow us to identify salient risks, build capacity \nand business-level ownership aligned to those risks, and \nconduct targeted human rights and environmental due \ndiligence to monitor and manage compliance.\n\nOur Salient Human Rights Risks\n\n\u2022  Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\u2022  Safe and Healthy Working Conditions\n\u2022  Modern Slavery and Forced Labor\n\u2022  Fair Wages and Hours\n\u2022  Freedom of Association\n\u2022  Future of Work\n\u2022  Right to Privacy\n\u2022  Product Safety and Security\n\u2022  Social, Economic, and Environmental Justice\n\nLearn more about our salient human rights risks \non our website\u00a0\n\nIn 2022, following several other HRIAs, we published an \nHRIA report with Twitch\u00a0 \u2009.27 In 2023, we conducted a human \nrights saliency assessment for Amazon Private Brands to \nbetter understand priority human rights risks across our \nproducts and how to best address them. We also identified \nways to facilitate stakeholder relationships at a more \nlocalized level in the Private Brands supply chain.\n\nWhole Foods Market, with support from Amazon\u2019s central \nhuman rights team, worked with third-party advisory firm \nHuman Level to conduct a human rights due diligence \nmanagement assessment in 2023. This assessment helped \nWhole Foods Market better understand and improve the \nquality of its human rights due diligence governance.\u00a0In \n2024, we are building on the success of Whole Foods \nMarket\u2019s 2023 human rights due diligence management \nassessment by expanding it to all of Amazon\u2019s global \ngrocery\u00a0business. \n\nIdentifying and Addressing Modern Slavery \nIndicators across Amazon \n\nAddressing modern slavery requires a holistic approach that \nincludes commitments, resources, and innovative solutions \nfrom governments, international organizations, the private \nsector, and civil society. At Amazon, we understand the \nimportant role we can play in eradicating this issue and are \ncommitted to expanding our work to understand and address \nany modern slavery risks that may arise in our business.\n\nWe place a specific focus on vulnerable workers, including \nforeign and domestic migrant workers; contract, agency, \nand temporary workers; refugees; asylum seekers; ethnic/\nreligious minorities and displaced persons; Indigenous \npeoples; and young or student workers. \n\nIn 2023, we launched a new initiative to identify and \nproactively address forced labor and modern slavery risk \nindicators across our business. The program brings together \nteams across our company\u00a0to identify and eliminate any \ninstances of exploitation\u2014with a focus on victim safety.\u00a0\n\nWorking with both internal and external experts in human \ntrafficking, the cross-functional team is establishing clear \nprotocols, mandatory training, and policies on identifying \npotential victims of forced labor or modern slavery \nwithin our business operations, as well as detailing what \nemployees should do if they observe any indicators of \nhuman trafficking. These include guidance on ensuring victim \nsafety and providing immediate support and assistance to \nthem, as well as involving relevant authorities and support \norganizations.

Products sold in \nAmazon stores, as well as products and services provided \nto us, must be manufactured, produced, or provided in \naccordance with these standards. \n\nAn important part of our efforts to improve conditions \nacross our supply chain is assessing human rights risks to \naddress both site-specific challenges and broader, systemic \nissues. We work with our suppliers\u2014and other partners, as \ndescribed in this section and our Human Rights section\u00a0 \u2009\u2014\nto proactively mitigate these risks. We encourage suppliers to \n\nestablish management systems to oversee their compliance \nwith applicable laws, compliance with our Supply Chain \nStandards, and\u00a0progress on addressing their most salient \nhuman rights and environmental risks.\u00a0We also continuously \nmonitor regulations in the countries where we operate and \nactively engage with our teams and suppliers to meet new \nregulatory\u00a0requirements. \n\nconsumer electronics, food and beverage, and home goods \nproducts. Our 2023 supplier list included nearly 2,230 \nfinished-product suppliers. We update our supply chain map \nannually to provide customers and external stakeholders \nmore current visibility into where we source. In 2024, we will \nbegin to expand our supplier list and supply chain map to \ninclude some apparel component suppliers. \n\nSelling Partners and Our \nStandards\nSelling partners are third-party sellers and retail vendors \nthat sell or provide products and services in Amazon \nstores. Our Supply Chain Standards apply to all products \nand services offered\u00a0in our stores. We encourage selling \npartners to perform due diligence to help ensure their \nproducts and services are produced and supplied in ways that \nrespect human rights and the environment and protect the \nfundamental dignity of workers. \n\nIf we have reason to suspect that products from our selling \npartners do not meet our standards, we may request \nevidence of due diligence to demonstrate that products were \nindeed manufactured in accordance with our Supply Chain \nStandards. We reserve the right to remove products that do \nnot meet our standards from our stores.\n\nSupply Chain Transparency\u00a0\nSupply chain transparency is a valuable tool to address \nrisks in our supply chain and identify opportunities for \ncollaboration on systemic issues.\u00a0That\u2019s why we publish a \n\u00a0with details \nsupplier list and interactive supply chain map\u00a0\non finished-product suppliers of Amazon-branded apparel, \n\n\u00a0to foster brand collaboration and action in the \n\nWe also contribute our supplier list to the\u00a0Open Supply \nHub\u00a0\nindustry.

These categories include subcategories such \nas nondiscrimination, emergency preparedness, hazardous \nsubstances, and transparency. By assessing the performance \nof our suppliers, we improve working conditions and \nstrengthen the resilience of our supply chain.\n\nWe accept audits completed by qualified independent \naudit firms based on our own standards and those of \nindustry associations, including the Sedex Members Ethical \n\nTrade Audit (SMETA), amfori Business Social Compliance \nInitiative (amfori BSCI), Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), \nSocial Accountability International (SA8000 standard and \ncertification system), and Better Work. \n\nWhen we identify a gap between a supplier\u2019s practices \nand our Supply Chain Standards, we track remediation \nand conduct follow-up assessments as needed.

We want to ensure they comply \nwith our Supply Chain Standards and continuously improve. \nWe assess the performance of our suppliers, take action \nwhen we identify concerns, and offer capacity-building \nprograms to prevent identified issues from happening again.\n\nSupplier Assessments\nOur approach to enabling a more responsible supply chain is \nrooted in our commitment to workers and based on a model \nof continuous improvement. We offer on-site and remote \ntraining to support supplier remediation, and we expect \nsuppliers to act within an agreed-upon timeline, remove \nharm, act in the best interests of workers, and commit to \npreventing similar issues in the future. We know that change \ndoes not happen overnight and are committed to supporting \nour suppliers in remediating issues over time.\n\nAssessment findings are flagged as high, medium, or low \ndepending on severity. When high- and medium-level issues \nare identified, we take steps to verify that suppliers have \nmade meaningful progress toward remediation. \n\nA high-level finding is an issue that has caused or is likely \nto cause immediate harm to workers or communities or \ndemonstrates egregious unethical behavior. A medium-\nlevel finding is an issue that poses significant risk of \nharm to workers or communities or demonstrates \nunethical or exploitative behavior.

These trainings reached \n458\u00a0suppliers in 14 countries/regions. \n\nWe also launched a new in-person peer-learning workshop \nseries that convenes factory management to hear from \nindustry experts and share best practices for addressing \ncommon challenges. This workshop series reached 105 \nsuppliers in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Mainland China, Malaysia, \nSaudi Arabia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United \nArab Emirates. \n\nWe also continued our work with the Indirect Spend \nAlliance (ISA), an industry working group that aims to \nidentify operational areas of shared human rights risks \nin procurement and to design a single industry approach \nto address hotspots. In 2023, in partnership with ISA, \nwe created a\u00a0risk matrix outlining human rights risks for \nour indirect spend areas including construction, waste \nmanagement, and shipping. Companies we contract with to \nprovide goods and services directly to Amazon can use this \nmatrix to better understand key human rights risks. \n\nProgress across Our Six Priority \nCommitment Areas \nIn 2023, we continued making progress across each of our six \npriority commitment areas through continuous commitment \nand action. \n\nSafe and Healthy Workplaces\n\nEveryone has the right to a safe and healthy workplace with \nappropriate rules and practices for reporting and preventing \n\naccidents, injuries, and unsafe conditions. We work with \nsuppliers globally to support worker health and safety \nthrough targeted programs and partnerships that increase \nworker awareness of safety issues, support their well-being, \nand promote a culture of shared safety responsibility. \n\nWe also partner with global organizations that are dedicated \nto maintaining safe and healthy workplaces in the countries \nwhere we operate. In February 2024, we joined Nirapon \n(safe place in Bangla), an industry-led nonprofit that works \nwith global brands, retailers, manufacturers, and other \nnongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to create and sustain \na culture of workplace safety in factories in Bangladesh.\n\nBuilding, Electrical, and Fire Safety\u00a0\nBuilding, electrical, and fire safety is a critical part of our \ncommitment to maintain safe and healthy workplaces. In \n2023, we began the process to join Life and Building Safety \n(LABS) Initiative, officially becoming members in April 2024. \nLABS is an industry-driven program working to mitigate \npreventable fire, electrical, and structural building safety \nrisks in key apparel- and footwear-producing countries.\n\nThrough our Building, Electrical, and Fire Safety (BEFS) \nprogram, we also conduct issue-specific assessments that \nidentify and remediate structural, electrical, and fire safety \nissues, going beyond traditional social compliance audits in \ncountries that are not covered by Nirapon or LABS. In 2023, \nwe completed BEFS assessments for Tier 1 supplier sites in \nCambodia and Pakistan. \n\nMeasuring Good Health \nExamining the outcomes of our health and safety programs \nand partnerships helps build evidence for continued \ninvestment in worker health that can support ongoing \nand future efforts throughout our supply chain. In 2023, \nan assessment we conducted found that every dollar we \ninvested in supplier health projects during COVID-19 in \nBangladesh and Vietnam generated approximately $3.02 of \nsocioeconomic value, including reduced health expenditures \nfor our factory workforce and their families, health care \nworkers, suppliers, and implementing partners (e.g., PATH \n\nand Catalyst Management Services). Across both countries, \nwe helped 26\u00a0suppliers plan and manage their responses \nto the pandemic and provide health care services to \napproximately 60,000 frontline workers between January \n2022 and March 2023. \n\nLearn more about how we embed health and safety \nconsiderations into our own workplace operations\u00a0\n\nGender Equity  \n\nAmazon has a long-standing commitment to gender \nequity, which is a fundamental human right and necessary \nfoundation of a sustainable supply chain.\u00a0We strive to engage \nwith more women-owned businesses throughout our supply \nchains and support women in making their own decisions on \nhealth, finances, and career development.\n\nIn 2023, we joined the advisory board of the Resilience \nFund for Women in Global Value Chains, created to support \nwomen\u2019s economic resilience, health, and well-being. \nBetween April 2022 and March 2023, the fund committed \nmore than $1.7 million in flexible grant funding to women-\nled organizations in South and Southeast Asia that work on \nsexual and reproductive health programs and services or \nprevention of gender-based violence.  \n\nWe also developed and launched i4Equality, a training \nprogram covering gender equity and the prevention of sexual \nharassment in the workplace, women\u2019s health, workplace \ndialogue, and financial literacy for suppliers in China, India, \nand Sri Lanka. By the end of 2023, nearly 1,750\u00a0workers, \nincluding over 1,180 female workers, had completed the \ntraining in China and India.\u00a0In China, 90% of participants \nreported that they were aware of their workplace\u2019s sexual \nharassment prevention policies, compared to 48% before we \nlaunched the program.\n\nLearn more about our approach to promoting equity across \nour value chain\u00a0\n\n and enhancing supplier diversity\u00a0\n\nFair Wages\n\nWe believe everyone has a right to be paid fairly for the work \nthey perform, and ensuring workers receive fair pay remains \na global, cross-industry issue. That\u2019s why fair wages is one of \nour six priority commitment areas.\u00a0\n\nWe monitor\u00a0wage payments throughout our supply chains \nto inform more meaningful supplier engagements, enhance \nour human rights due diligence processes, and promote \ncontinuous improvement in the fair and on-time payment of \nwages. In accordance with our Supply Chain Standards, our \nsuppliers must pay legally required compensation, including \novertime and benefits, and we support them in evaluating \nwhether their workers earn enough to meet their basic \nneeds and those of their families. In 2023, we began working \nwith\u00a0select suppliers to benchmark worker compensation \nagainst regionally specific fair wages, focusing on electronics \nmanufacturing and packaging\u2014two areas where there is a \nlack of industry-wide data on worker wages. In 2024, we will \nexpand these efforts to apparel manufacturing.\u00a0\n\nProgress on wages and working hours requires us to \ncontinuously evaluate and strengthen our own processes, \nincluding our purchasing practices. Based on anonymous \nsupplier feedback collected through the\u00a0Better Buying \nInstitute\u00a0\nforecasting, communication, and payments systems, and \nmoving forward, we will use the Better Buying survey to \nmeasure whether these programs had a positive impact.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n, we implemented new programs to improve our \n\nResponsible Recruitment and Freely Chosen \nEmployment\n\n, we do \n\nAs outlined in our Global Human Rights Principles\u00a0\nnot tolerate child labor, forced labor, or human trafficking \nin any form in our operations or supply chain. We advance \nholistic approaches to combat forced labor and ensure \nvulnerable workers, especially foreign migrants, have access \nto transparent information on working conditions including \npay, hiring practices, and contract terms.\n\nSustainable Products and MaterialsResponsible Supply ChainHuman RightsCommunity ImpactSupplier Diversity2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue Chain\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n55\n\nPartnering to Drive Workplace Health\nand Safety\nIn 2023, we collaborated with organizations around the \nworld to support workers\u2019 rights to safe and healthy \nworkplaces.

From December \n2021 to October 2023, we provided access to \ncritical primary health care services to over \n40,000 workers.\n\nWe continued to work with the International \nLabour Organization (ILO) Sustaining \nCompetitive and Responsible Enterprises \n(SCORE) program to support productive, healthy, \nand safe working environments among small \nand medium manufacturers. In 2023, 18 of our \nsuppliers participated in SCORE training across \nChina, India, and Indonesia, participating in over \n8,500 hours of training. Third-party assessments \nconducted before and after training identified \nimprovements in workplace health and safety, \nproductivity, and worker satisfaction, as well as a \nreduction in accidents.\n\n to develop the Wellness4All program. \n\nWe continued to partner with the international \nnonprofit PATH to support healthy communities \nin our supply chain. In 2023, we worked with \nPATH \nAvailable to Amazon suppliers and workers \nin Vietnam, the new program includes more \ne-learnings and tools designed to improve larger \nworkplace health and safety systems, building \nsuppliers\u2019 capacity to support workers on various \nhealth issues and driving positive practices on \nboth the physical and mental health of workers.\n\nIn Bangladesh, we joined an initiative in \ncollaboration with the government to better \nprotect garment workers, led by the ILO and \nthe Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale \nZusammenarbeit (GIZ), an agency focused \non international cooperation for sustainable \ndevelopment. The initiative seeks to strengthen \nemployment injury insurance in the Bangladesh \ngarment sector, so that workers have access to \nimmediate financial support in case of any work-\nrelated injuries.\n\nThrough our ongoing collaboration with Swasti, \na global nonprofit dedicated to providing quality \nhealth care for marginalized workers in India, we \nprovided access to primary health care, delivered \ntrainings on social protection, and raised \nawareness of gender equity and the prevention \nof sexual harassment among our supply chain \nemployees in India. As of the end of 2023, we \nhad reached over 2,060 workers in India through \nSwasti\u2019s health care programs. \n\nIn partnership with Social Accountability \nInternational (SAI), we launched SAI\u2019s \nTenSquared in 2023, a new worker engagement \nprogram for suppliers in China, India, and \nMalaysia to solve health and safety issues. The \nstructured workplace engagement program \nunites workers and managers to address the \nroot causes of workplace issues and includes a \ngoal to measurably improve a specific workplace \nchallenge in 100 days. In this way, it helps \novercome institutional hurdles to foster a \nculture of continuous improvement.

This includes ending worker-\npaid recruitment fees\u2014a practice prohibited by our Supply \nChain Standards\u2014and requiring suppliers to reimburse \nany fees paid by workers at any phase of the recruitment \nprocess.\u00a0When we find evidence of recruitment fees, we work \nwith our suppliers to raise their understanding of responsible \nrecruitment practices, create and implement remediation \nplans to prevent recruitment fees from being charged at any \npoint in the hiring process moving forward, and reimburse \naffected workers in full and in a manner that protects them \nand their families from harm and retaliation.\n\nIn 2023, we continued to introduce new ways to accelerate \nindustry-wide progress in this priority commitment area. \nAmazon and the International Organization for Migration \n(IOM) partnered to collaborate on Promoting the Respect \nof Human and Labor Rights of Migrant Workers in Global \nSupply Chains. Through this strategic collaboration, we \nwill work together to advance our suppliers\u2019 and business \npartners\u2019 respect of migrant workers\u2019 rights and improve \nsafe labor migration and socioeconomic inclusion. Amazon \nand IOM will focus on human rights due diligence, mapping \nlabor migration processes across relevant corridors, capacity \nbuilding of supply chain partners in countries of origin and \ndestination, and engaging in multi-stakeholder initiatives to \ndrive positive change across relevant industries.\n\nWe encourage suppliers to participate in external training \nprograms, such as industry association tutorials, to enable \nthem to better recognize and prevent modern slavery and \nimplement high-quality management systems. We also \nprovide suppliers with responsible recruitment training. In \n2023, we extended our responsible recruitment training to \nour logistics and services providers and expanded offerings \nin additional countries that are common destinations for \nforeign migrant workers. Working with the Issara Institute, \nMicroBenefits, the Mekong Club, and Verit\u00e9, we offered \n\nResponding to Violations of Our Supply \nChain Standards in Saudi Arabia\n\nIn 2023, Amazon found violations of our Supply \nChain Standards at a third-party licensed temporary \nlabor agency (\u201cthird-party vendor\u201d) in Saudi Arabia \nthrough an independent audit. The violations ranged \nfrom recruitment fees paid by migrant workers to \nthe absence of grievance mechanisms and issues with \nworker accommodations. External organizations raised \nsimilar concerns and shared information with us about \nthese and other human rights risks collected during \ninterviews with former employees of this third-party \nvendor. \n\nIn response, we conducted a deeper dive into practices \nof our third-party vendors throughout Saudi Arabia \nand developed a series of short- and long-term \nmeasures to remedy immediate issues and prevent \nfuture recurrence. We brought in two independent \nthird parties to assist with our investigation and \nengaged directly with contracted workers through \ninterviews to help establish reimbursement amounts \nand manage repayment. As of February 2024, we had \nreimbursed more than 700\u00a0contracted workers across \nall our third-party vendors in Saudi Arabia, totaling \nmore than $1.9\u00a0million\u00a0in reimbursed recruitment fees \nand related costs.\u00a0Through audits, we also verified \nthat the third-party vendor remediated concerns \n\nabout worker housing. Additionally, we secured the \nvendor\u2019s commitment that even after its employees \nno longer work at Amazon, it will pay them in line \nwith their contracts and won\u2019t move them to a new \naccommodation site that fails to meet Amazon\u2019s \nstandards. The vendor also established a more robust \nsystem to enable workers to anonymously raise \ngrievances moving forward. \n\nWe also adopted enhanced controls to reduce the \nrisk of recurrence, including strengthening contracts \nto clarify expectations regarding compliance with \nour Supply Chain Standards; reviewing wage policies, \nincluding clarification that illegal wage deductions are \nprohibited; providing additional training to vendors \nin the region on how to implement our Supply Chain \nStandards, including responsible recruitment practices; \nand improving our communication mechanism that \nenables contracted workers to share concerns directly \nwith Amazon management. We continue to monitor \nimprovements and progress, including through \nongoing site visits, and are committed to ongoing and \ncontinuous improvement region-wide.\n\nLearn more about our response on About Amazon\u00a0\n\nsupplier training sessions on modern slavery risks and \nresponsible recruitment practices in Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, \nSingapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates. \nThese sessions focused on topics including implementing \neffective risk mitigation controls, identifying issues in \nrecruitment and hiring processes for migrant workers, and \nestablishing strong management systems to address and \nprevent these issues.\n\nLearn more about our work to address human trafficking in \n and in our \nour supply chain in our Human Rights section \nModern Slavery Statement\u00a0\n\nEnvironmental Protection \n\nAs one of our six priority commitment areas, we strive \nto source products and services that avoid unnecessary \nenvironmental harm. To do this, we work with industry \nexperts to increase our understanding of the environmental \nchallenges we face, our performance against them, and \neffective solutions we can implement to address them.\n\nFor example, since 2020, we have worked with the Institute \nof Public & Environmental Affairs, a nonprofit environmental \nresearch organization in China that focuses on promoting \nenvironmental information disclosure and improving \nenvironmental governance. We leverage its public database \nto screen our supplier sites in China for environmental \nviolations. In 2023, we screened 100% of our product \nmanufacturing suppliers of Amazon Private Brands, AWS, \nAmazon Devices, and Amazon Fresh Private Brands in China. \nWhen we identified concerns, we worked with suppliers to \nremediate them. We also encouraged suppliers to publicly \ndisclose their corrective actions to drive transparency \nand\u00a0accountability. \n\nIndustry associations are another important part of our work \nto help our suppliers reduce their emissions and resource \n, Amazon encourages suppliers to \nuse.

We are investing in identifying and \naddressing the most severe human rights and environmental \nrisks throughout our supply chain. We will continue engaging \ninternal and external stakeholders in our efforts to make \nprogress across our six priority commitment areas and, in \ndoing so, enable working conditions that respect supply chain \nworkers and the environments where we operate.\n\nModule (FEM), a self-assessment owned and developed by \n sustainability \nCascale, exclusively licensed to the Worldly\u00a0\ndata and insights platform. The assessment evaluates \nperformance and prioritizes opportunities for improvement \nacross seven areas: air emissions, carbon emissions, chemicals \nmanagement, environmental management systems, waste, \nwastewater, and water. In 2023, 67% of Amazon\u2019s Private \nBrands Tier 1 apparel suppliers completed the Higg FEM, \nhelping them better understand their environmental \nperformance and practices.\n\nLearn more about how we engage suppliers to help us \nmeet our goal to reach net-zero carbon emissions\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAccess to Effective Grievance Mechanisms\n\nWe want our supply chain workers to have the ability to \nvoice their concerns about the workplace in a safe and \nconfidential manner. To do this, we connect suppliers and \nservice providers with trusted tools, products, and systems \nto hear directly from workers about their experiences and \nsupport the resolution of issues from workers\u2019 perspectives. \nWe believe this is fundamental to supporting the safety and \nwell-being of the workers in our supply chain.\n\nIn 2023, we\u00a0helped connect supplier sites across Bangladesh, \nCambodia, China, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand \nwith independent grievance mechanisms. Of the nearly 800 \nworker grievances raised using these mechanisms, 100% \nwere investigated and resolved.  \n\nThe Amader Kotha Helpline and Ulula\u00a0are two examples \nof effective grievance mechanisms that we introduced \nto our suppliers. The Amader Kotha Helpline is an \nindependent helpline serving the ready-made garment \nsector in Bangladesh, while Ulula uses a range of grievance \nmechanisms\u2014including helplines to messaging platforms\u2014\n\nto serve workers and communities in industries spanning \ngarment, agriculture, mining, and more. Using these \nchannels, suppliers can gather feedback directly from \nworkers to inform more effective issue resolution. In 2023, \nthrough the Amader Kotha Helpline, workers in Bangladesh \nreported nearly 760\u00a0grievances, of which over 560 related \nto workplace concerns. The top five workplace concerns for \nAmazon suppliers were wages, leave, verbal abuse, factory \nwelfare facilities, and termination, while the remaining \ninquiries included more general topics such as domestic \nissues or the government\u2019s policy on worker benefits. Ulula, \nmeanwhile, is available to workers in Cambodia, China, India, \nand Pakistan. During 2023, workers with access to Ulula \nmost frequently reported issues related to health and safety \nand\u00a0wages. \n\nIn 2023, we expanded our grievance mechanisms program \nto include additional supplier segments across our supply \nchain. In Japan, we partnered with the Japan Platform \nfor Migrant Workers Towards Responsible and Inclusive \nSociety (JP-MIRAI) so that certain suppliers in Japan could \nprovide their workers access to JP-MIRAI\u2019s independent \ngrievance\u00a0mechanism. \n\nIn the Middle East, North Africa, Mexico, the UK, and the U.S., \nwe conducted focus groups with contract workers within \nour global operations to understand their familiarity with \ngrievance mechanisms, whether they are able to access them, \nand what barriers they face in using them. \n\nFor all individuals, including members of the public, \nemployees, and workers in our supply chain, we introduced \na new way to notify us about potential human rights and \nenvironmental concerns\u2014a web form\u00a0\n where people \ncan anonymously report cases directly to Amazon. The \nform is available in 19 languages and dialects and can be \naccessed\u00a0globally. \n\nReport to Resolution: The Amader Kotha \nProcess in Action\u00a0\n\nWhenever grievances are raised through the \nAmader Kotha Helpline, the organization works \nwith factory management to address and resolve \nissues as quickly as possible and, ultimately, \nimprove working conditions for employees. \n\nFor example, in 2023, a worker called the helpline \nto raise a concern about a supervisor using \nabusive language with employees. The caller \nwanted the behavior to stop but did not want to \nanger the supervisor or be singled out. To ensure \ntimely and effective remediation, Amader Kotha \nquickly contacted our supplier\u2019s management \nwithout disclosing any personal information that \ncould identify the complainant. In response, the \nsupplier\u2019s management counseled the supervisor \non appropriate behavior, after which the worker \nnoticed a marked improvement in the supervisor\u2019s \nlanguage.\u00a0We are proud to support Amader \nKotha\u2019s efforts to bring about timely remediation \nto worker concerns and improve working \nconditions in manufacturing facilities.\n\nSustainable Products and MaterialsResponsible Supply ChainHuman RightsCommunity ImpactSupplier Diversity2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue Chain\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n58\n\nSustainable \nProducts and \nMaterials\n\nCustomers want products that align with their \nvalues, and this often includes products created \nwith sustainability in mind.

We also consider the use phase of our \nproducts and have programs in place to help customers keep \ntheir products in use for longer. In 2023, we expanded these \nefforts by launching a spare parts and repair program in \nEurope for our private brands products.\u00a0\n\n to home textile products, which we \n\n\u00a0for cleaning, beauty, and personal care.

In 2023, we \nlaunched 28 new Echo, Fire TV, Fire tablet, Kindle e-reader, \nRing, Blink, and smart home devices and accessories that \nwere recognized by certifications in our Climate Pledge \nFriendly program.\n\nWe design our devices with a focus on carbon reduction \nand manufacture them with responsibly sourced materials. \nSustainability is considered throughout the lifecycle of a \nproduct\u2014from how we build it to how our customers use \nand retire it. We want every new Amazon device to be \nmore energy-efficient and less resource-intensive than the \nprevious generation.\u00a0\n\nLearn more about how we are making our devices more \ncarbon- and resource-efficient\u00a0 \u2009, investing in carbon-free \nenergy\u00a0 \u2009, and giving devices a second chance\u00a0\n\nWe incorporate recycled materials into our devices whenever \npossible. As of the end of 2023, among Echo, Fire TV, Fire \ntablet, Kindle, and smart home products, we had various \nproducts made from majority- or all-recycled content, \nincluding those containing: \n\n\u2022  75% recycled plastic \n\u2022  100% recycled yarn\n\u2022  100% recycled aluminum \n\u2022  90% recycled magnesium\n\nIn addition to using recycled materials in our devices, we \nextend this practice to device packaging.\n\nLearn more about our device packaging\u00a0\ndevice recycling\u00a0\n\n and  \n\nResponsible Mineral Sourcing\nWhile Amazon does not engage in direct sourcing from \nmine sites and smelters, we are committed to avoiding the \nuse of minerals that have fueled conflict. We\u00a0strive to have \n100% of tin, tungsten, tantalum, and gold (3TG) smelters \nand refiners in our supply chain conform with a recognized \nminerals certification program. These certifications, such \nas the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI)\u2019s Responsible \nMinerals Assurance Process (RMAP), are critical to enabling \nresponsible raw material sourcing and processing upstream \nin the supply chain. We support suppliers in their efforts \nto increase smelter audits through RMAP, and we expect \nour suppliers to remove nonconformant smelters from our \nsupply chain.\n\nCobalt is a raw mineral used in batteries, including those \nfor electric vehicles.\u00a0In 2023, we built on our existing 3TG \ndue diligence processes\u00a0and conducted cobalt due diligence \nwith additional suppliers using industry-standard reporting \ntemplates. This improves our efforts to understand and \nmitigate risks in the cobalt supply chain while also signaling \nto suppliers the importance of responsible mineral sourcing \nbeyond 3TG.\n\nWe engage suppliers on the importance of responsible \nmineral sourcing mechanisms and industry collaboration. \nWe also maintain membership in RMI, the Copper Mark, \nand the Public-Private Alliance for Responsible Minerals \nTrade. Through these, we collaborate with industry peers, \ngovernments, and civil society actors on increasing supply \nchain transparency and improving sourcing across mineral \nvalue chains.\n\nIn 2023, we partnered with the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment (USAID), BHP Foundation\u00a0\n, and the Chandler \nFoundation for the Powering a Just Energy Transition Green \nMinerals Challenge (JET Minerals Challenge). Amazon \nmentored finalists and participated in a pitch workshop \nto catalyze the development, application, and scaling \nof innovations to strengthen transparency and counter \ncorruption in critical mineral supply chains. The JET Minerals \nChallenge closed with 11 winners from 15 countries and \ntargeted more than 10 mineral supply chains critical to the \nenergy transition. \n\nClimate Pledge Friendly\nCertifications\n\nOur Climate Pledge Friendly program helps customers \ndiscover more sustainable products that are recognized to \nhave at least one sustainable feature. In 2023, our customers \ncontinued to embrace this program, purchasing 1.16 billion \nitems recognized by certifications in the Climate Pledge \nFriendly program\u2014a 42% increase from 2022.\n\nIn order to provide this breadth of options for our customers, \nwe encourage our selling partners to develop and offer \nproducts that meet the criteria for one or more of the 55 \ncertifications in our Climate Pledge Friendly program. These \ncertifications recognize products that address at least one \naspect of sustainability, ranging from recycled content to \nenergy efficiency to safer chemicals. \n\nWe routinely assess the certification landscape, adding \nand developing new certifications for the program and \n\nreviewing our existing ones against our high bar for \ntransparency, credibility, and customer trust. International \nSustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC+) to help \ncustomers easily identify products that are made with \nrecycled content and bio-based materials. We also added \nthe U.S. Cotton Trust Protocol, a product-traceable cotton \nstandard that drives continuous improvement across water \nuse, energy efficiency, carbon emissions, soil conservation, \nsoil carbon, and land use. When selling partners offer a \nproduct with a sustainability feature not captured by an \nexisting certification in the program, we consider supporting \nopportunities to fill the gap. For example, in 2023, Amazon \ninitiated the development of the Recycled Content Standard \nfor Electronics and Electrical Equipment in partnership with \nstandards development organization SCS Standards. This \ninvolved\u00a0a multi-stakeholder process with representatives \nfrom industry and NGOs including the Center for the Circular \nEconomy at Closed Loop Partners,\u00a0the Ellen MacArthur \nFoundation, De\u2019Longhi, Dell Technologies, HP, Microsoft, \nLogitech, Philips, and The Recycling Partnership.\n\nWe expanded our collaboration with the Ellen MacArthur \nFoundation to drive scalable, industry-wide solutions for a \ncircular economy in 2023. As a Strategic Partner of the Ellen \nMacArthur Foundation Network, we are working to leverage \nour reach, technology, and innovation capabilities and the \nfoundation\u2019s subject-matter expertise to launch and scale \ncircular economy solutions. Through this partnership, we are \nworking to develop certifications for products with circular \nfeatures, providing customers with the information they \nneed to make a more circular choice. These certifications \nencourage brands, original equipment manufacturers, \nsuppliers, retailers, and e-commerce platforms to create \nproducts that are designed in accordance with circular \neconomy principles.\n\nWe collaborate with our selling partners to identify \nopportunities for them\u00a0to develop more sustainable products \nand apply for certifications that recognize the strides they \nare already making in sustainability.

To achieve this, we are prioritizing \nthree actions:\n\n\u2022  Driving economic benefits by scaling existing \n\nand onboarding new certified diverse suppliers, \nwhich are businesses certified to be at least 51% \nowned and operated by an individual or group \nthat is part of a traditionally underrepresented or \nunderserved\u00a0community \n\n\u2022  Expanding SDI initiatives across the globe \n\u2022  Partnering with advocacy organizations to further \n\nengage with certified Tier 1 diverse suppliers worldwide\n\nWithin Amazon\u2019s supply chain,\u00a0we require that diverse \nsuppliers have a valid certification from one of our \nrecognized certification agencies.

By building and strengthening \nour SDI processes, technologies, and partnerships, we were \nable to increase our U.S. certified Tier 1 diversity spend by \n30%\u00a0to $4.3\u00a0billion in 2023. In 2023, Amazon\u2019s SDI program \nis estimated to have supported over 30,000 U.S. jobs at \ncertified Tier 1 diverse suppliers, generating approximately \n$2.8\u00a0billion in wages.\n\nOur efforts included expanding\u00a0how we identify and \nintroduce underrepresented classifications into our \nsupply chain, improving validation of underrepresented \nclassifications, developing existing suppliers for future \ngrowth, and working with our teams to better understand \nprocurement categories where opportunities for greater \ninclusion exist.\n\nWhile spending directly with certified Tier 1 diverse suppliers \nis at the foundation of Amazon\u2019s SDI program, we are \nalso focused on expanding this work to underrepresented \ncompanies deeper in our supply chain. We do this by \nencouraging our Tier 1 suppliers to consider diverse \nbusinesses in their procurement processes, creating a ripple \neffect. We refer to this as our Tier 2 SDI spend, an area we \nbelieve can have an exponential influence on thousands of \ndiverse businesses around the world. In 2023, more than 200 \nof our Tier 1 suppliers spent $1.5\u00a0billion with certified diverse \n\nbusinesses.

We focus on \nseveral priority areas across our business and respond \nto emergent needs where we are uniquely positioned to \nmake a positive difference. Our work especially emphasizes \nhistorically underrepresented communities, because we \nenvision a world that embraces diverse perspectives and \nwhere all individuals have equitable opportunities. \n\nAmazon\u2019s community impact efforts are focused on seven \nkey areas:\n\n\u2022  Supporting economic impact in communities: Amazon \n\nadds economic vibrancy to the communities where we \noperate through investments and job creation. Our \ninvestments in economies across the globe expand \nopportunities for local residents and small businesses \nand catalyze local economic activity.\n\n\u2022  Creating and preserving affordable housing: All people \nshould have access to housing they can afford, but many \ncommunities in the U.S. are facing an affordable housing \nshortage, with low-income and minority families \ndisproportionately affected.

The fund finances \ncommunity-focused projects that mitigate the effects of climate change, improve \nbiodiversity, enhance livelihoods, and add green space to urban areas. In 2023, we \ncontinued to fund nature projects in communities around the world. \n\nIreland: Amazon donated \u20ac2.5\u00a0million to The Nature \nTrust to help rehabilitate up to 500 hectares of degraded \nAtlantic blanket bog and restore it to a functioning \npeatland habitat. \n\nUnited States: Volunteers from Amazon helped restore \nOlympia oyster populations in the Puget Sound region of \nWashington. In 2022 and 2023, we committed $310,000 \nto the Puget Sound Restoration Fund to help plant more \nthan 3 million oyster seeds. In California, Amazon donated \n$100,000 to The Bay Foundation to restore approximately \n2.5 acres of giant kelp forests off the state\u2019s southern coast. \n\nSpain: In partnership with CIFAL M\u00e1laga-UNITAR (the United \nNations Institute for Training and Research), we launched the \nGreen Helmets education initiative, designed to teach young \npeople how to develop and implement nature conservation \nprojects. Nearly 3,650 students from 60 schools in Andalusia \ncompleted the training and submitted project ideas that \ncontribute to the recovery and protection of nature. Ten \nprojects were selected to be developed in 2024, with each \nreceiving \u20ac10,000 from the Right Now Climate Fund. The \ninitiative also planted 20,000 trees and distributed more \nthan 26,000 seed bombs, with drones distributing more than \n400,000 seeds to 500 hectares of difficult-to-access areas in the \nSierra Bermeja region that was recently devastated by wildfires.\n\nUnited Kingdom: We funded the planting of approximately \n450,000 trees across the country through the Woodland \nTrust\u2019s Emergency Tree Fund. We also contributed funding \nfor 22 nature restoration projects through the Mayor of \nLondon\u2019s Rewild London Fund, in partnership with London \nWildlife Trust and Groundwork London. These projects are \nprotecting water voles, improving habitats for reptiles, and \nreintroducing beavers to West London for the first time in \n400 years. Watch them take their first dip in the wild\u00a0\n\n. \n\nThe Netherlands: Amazon granted \u20ac1.5 million to a \nconsortium of partners headed by North Sea Farmers to \ndevelop the world\u2019s first commercial-scale seaweed farm \nlocated between offshore wind turbines. The project will \ntest methods of seaweed farming while researching the \npotential of seaweed to sequester carbon.\n\nAsia-Pacific: We announced\u00a0\n\u00a0$15\u00a0million for nature-based \nprojects in the region, with the first $3\u00a0million allocated to \nIndia. Amazon will allocate the remainder of this funding to \nother key biodiversity and climate adaptation hotspots in \nthe region. \n\nIndia: Amazon has committed 83 million INR ($1 million) to \nthe Centre for Wildlife Studies to support communities and \nconservation efforts in the Western Ghats. This UNESCO \nWorld Heritage Site and critical wildlife conservation zone is \nhome to wild Asian elephants and tigers. Amazon\u2019s funding \nwill expand the Wild Carbon project, which will enable \n2,000 farmers and their households to plant up to 300,000 \ntrees over three years.\n\nLearn more about our\u00a0large-scale, nature-based carbon \nneutralization initiatives\u00a0\n\nSustainable Products and MaterialsResponsible Supply ChainHuman RightsCommunity ImpactSupplier Diversity2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue Chain\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n7474\n\nPeople\n\nWe aim to be Earth\u2019s best employer and the safest place to work in our \nindustries\u2014a mindset that inspires us to take a people-first approach and \nprioritize making our workforce feel valued and supported, while building \na culture of inclusive experiences everywhere.\n\nIn This Section\n\n75  Employee Experience\n81  Health and Safety\n86 \n\nInclusive Experiences\n\nDynamo, Amazon\u2019s newest office building in Bellevue, Washington, provides office and collaboration space for employees working across \nvarious teams at Amazon.\n\n2023 Amazon Sustainability Report 2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue Chain\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n75\n75\n\nEmployee \nExperience \n\nPassionate, engaged employees are an important \npart of what makes Amazon successful.

We \ndo this in part by listening to our employees to understand \nhow we can design benefits that work for them and their \nfamilies and that are optimized for affordability, flexibility, \nchoice, and personalization. We strive to provide competitive \nand equitable compensation that rewards our employees for \ntheir\u00a0achievements. \n\nWe also want our employees to have the opportunity to \ngrow and thrive with us. As the skills needed for jobs in \nour sector rapidly evolve, we are preparing our employees \nby investing in training and development programs with \nreal-world applications. We do this by analyzing the labor \nmarket to identify in-demand jobs and providing education \nand training\u2014including through career coaching and our \nmentoring network\u2014that reflect the skills needed to be \nsuccessful in these roles.\n\nIn everything we do, we aim to create a culture of mutual \nrespect and progress, underpinned by candid, constructive \ncommunication. We offer multiple ways to ensure employees\u2019 \nvoices are heard and that they can share concerns and \nask questions, including our \u201copen door\u201d policy, whereby \nemployees can reach out to anyone in management \nwith suggestions, concerns, or feedback. Input from our \nemployees, collected from multiple channels, is used to \ncontinuously improve our workplace.\n\nOur Benefits\nWe offer a range of benefits that \nsupport our employees and eligible \nfamily members, including their \nchildren and domestic partners.

Our investments have \nhad a positive influence on local communities across \nthe U.S., helping to grow household incomes and boost \nlocal\u00a0economies. \n\nAmazon also invested $600\u00a0million in international wage \nincreases in 2023. In the UK, we committed to investing\u00a0\u00a3170 \nmillion\u00a0to increase the minimum starting hourly wage for \nour frontline operations employees between October 2023 \nand April 2024. By the end of 2023, we had increased the \nhourly wage in the UK to \u00a312, representing a 14% increase in \nstarting pay over two years and a 26% increase since 2018.\u00a0\n\nIn Germany, we increased the entry hourly wage for logistics \nemployees to\u00a0\u20ac14,\u00a0representing a 17% increase in average \nstarting pay since 2022 and a 30% increase since 2019. \nHourly wages automatically increase in Germany after 12 and \n24 months, with full-time employees earning an average of \n\u20ac37,000\u00a0per year after two years.\n\nWe also introduced\u00a0a new financial assistance program and \n with Brightside in 2023 to \nan emergency savings program\u00a0\nfurther support our customer fulfillment and transportation \nemployees. Brightside is a financial care solution currently \nbeing piloted for hourly employees in select states across \nthe U.S., providing free and confidential solutions to those \nexperiencing financial challenges or looking to improve their \nfinancial health. Our Brightside Financial Care pilot program \n\nconnects Amazon associates with financial solutions and \nresources that enhance their control over their personal \nfinances. Personal coaches offer live support to participants \nand use dynamic technology to recommend customized \nplans to improve their financial health and maximize the \nbenefits available to them through Amazon. In 2023, nearly \n28,900\u00a0associates engaged in this pilot program across \n12\u00a0states. We plan to expand the program to all U.S. hourly \nemployees in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, Brightside\u2019s emergency savings fund \nprogram\u00a0enables employees to prepare for life\u2019s unexpected \nexpenses by building an emergency financial reserve. \nParticipants can set aside a portion of their paycheck \nautomatically and access the funds when they are most \nneeded. Employees who take advantage of this benefit \nincrease their financial resiliency and confidence each pay \nperiod as they see their savings account balance grow. \nTogether, these programs have provided $13.9\u00a0million worth \nof financial resources to employees, helping them contribute \n$7.4\u00a0million to savings accounts that can be used for \nunexpected expenses. \n\nPay Equity \nWe continue to prioritize pay equity among our employees. \nA review of our 2023 compensation, including base pay, cash \nbonuses, and stock, found that women in the U.S. earned \n99.9\u00a0cents and women globally earned 99.8 cents for every \ndollar men earned performing the same jobs. The review also \nshowed that racial/ethnic minorities in the U.S. earned\u00a0one \ndollar\u00a0for every dollar white employees earned performing \nthe same jobs.\n\nRobust and Inclusive Benefits\nWe offer a range of benefits that support our employees \nand eligible family members, including their children \nand domestic partners. For regular full-time and part-\ntime employees, these benefits begin on the first day of \nemployment and include health care insurance coverage, \npaid parental leave,\u00a0ways to save for the future, our \nupskilling programs, and other resources to improve health \nand well-being.\n\nIn 2023, Amazon invested nearly $10 billion in total \nemployee benefits. To meet employees\u2019 needs, no matter \ntheir circumstances, we continued to expand our current \nofferings and introduce new ones. For example:\n\n\u2022  We launched new cross-border health plan options \n\nallowing employees who work in California to access \nhealth care in the Baja California region of Mexico. \n\n\u2022  In response to employee feedback indicating that they \nprefer the certainty of cost under a copay-based health \nplan over a more unpredictable coinsurance-based plan, \nwe converted our two most enrolled coinsurance plans \nto copay versions.\n\n\u2022  To make obtaining maintenance medication more \n\nconvenient for employees and support regimen \nadherence, Amazon increased the number of U.S. \npharmacies where employees can fill 90-day supplies. \nPreviously, 90-day supplies were restricted to a \ndesignated mail order pharmacy, while other pharmacies \nwere limited to filling up to 30-day supplies. \n\n\u2022  We\u00a0provided access to mental health counselors \n\nvia live chat for employees in Australia, Costa Rica, \nIndia, the United Arab Emirates, and the UK. We also \ncompleted the global rollout of our partnership with \n\nTwill Therapeutics, which provides self-guided tools for \neveryday mental health to employees and their families. \n\n\u2022  We launched Flexible Benefits in India and Canada, \noffering diverse employee cohorts the freedom to \ndesign their benefits packages to cater to their unique \nneeds and those of their families. In India, we designed a \nFlexible Benefits program that effectively builds custom \nsolutions for our diverse, multigenerational workforce. \nRecognizing that one size does not fit all, the program \nempowers employees to tailor their health and wellness \nbenefits to align with their individual life stages and \ncircumstances. In Canada, we introduced a Flexible \nBenefits program designed to increase employee choice \nby offering a new flexible plan for extended health, \nvision, and dental coverage in addition to the current \nplan, which includes a health care spending account \n(HSA) contribution to cover out-of-pocket expenses. \n\n\u2022  Compassionate care services\u2014our support for \n\nemployees and their dependents through difficult life \nevents\u2014were expanded beyond the U.S. to 60 new \ncountries.\u00a0These services include family bereavement \nsupport and free, confidential support to employees \nand their dependents who have been diagnosed with a \ncritical or terminal illness.\n\nAmazon solicits ongoing feedback from our workforce and \ninput from external partners to help ensure our health and \nwellness benefits meet the evolving needs of all employees. \nFor example, in 2023, we generally aligned our U.S. gender-\naffirming coverage with recommendations from the World \nProfessional Association for Transgender Health.\n\nGlobal Employee Assistance Program \n\nAlongside robust medical care, Amazon offers inclusive \nmental health support, including through our Employee \n\nInclusive ExperiencesHealth and SafetyEmployee Experience2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue Chain2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n78\n78\n\nAssistance Program (EAP).

Globally, our EAP was available to nearly \n1.6 million employees in 62 countries.\n\nSupporting the Health of Amazon Employees \nand Their Families\n\nNavigating health care for family planning and fertility \ncan be challenging, which is why Amazon proudly \nprovides our U.S. employees\u2014regardless of their gender, \nsexual orientation, or relationship status\u2014with family-\nbuilding benefits. This benefit offers support with in \nvitro fertilization (IVF), egg freezing, genetic testing, and \nmore, and it supported nearly\u00a030,400 full-time and hourly \nAmazon employees in 2023. Through this offering, our \nU.S. employees also receive access to approximately\u00a01,070 \nfertility specialists. In 2023, Amazon received the National \nInfertility Association\u2019s Award for Access, which recognizes \ncompanies whose work helps increase access to family-\nbuilding options for people living with infertility.\n\nWhen our employees are facing challenging times in terms \nof their health, we strive to be there to support them. In \n2023, we signed the Working with Cancer Pledge\u00a0\nsignify our continued commitment to providing a supportive \nworkplace culture for employees with cancer. This pledge \nsignals Amazon\u2019s dedication to providing leading health care \nbenefits and fostering compassion among managers and \nleaders across the company.\n\n to \n\nLearn more about how we support our employees and their \nfamilies during cancer diagnosis, treatment, and recovery\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nFlexible Scheduling\nOperations employees have provided us feedback that they \nwant more flexibility in when and how they work. That\u2019s \nwhy we offer various shift and schedule options, including \npermanent full- or part-time positions and seasonal work. \nOptions for morning, day, night, and weekend shifts are \nprovided, so employees can work during the times that best \nfit their circumstances. \n\nNot everyone has the same routine week to week. In \naddition to providing fixed schedules, we offer flexible \n\n that let employees choose when and how \n\noptions\u00a0\nmuch to work.\u00a0Amazon\u2019s Flexible Scheduling program lets \neligible employees choose their shift schedules using an \napp, letting them plan their workweeks in a way that suits \nthem. In 2023,\u00a0over 116,200\u00a0hourly fulfillment\u00a0employees \nused Flexible Scheduling (a 16% increase from 2022), \nincluding\u00a0nearly\u00a028,400\u00a0internal fixed-schedule associates \nwho transferred into the program. \n\nWorkforce Changes  \nIn January 2023, Amazon announced the difficult decision \nto eliminate\u00a018,000 roles, with an additional 9,000 roles \neliminated in April 2023. Several of our businesses were \naffected by these decisions. We did not make these decisions \nlightly and were committed to providing support to ease \nthe transition out of Amazon. Employees whose roles were \neliminated received a separation payment, external job \nplacement support, and region-specific transitional health \ninsurance benefits, where applicable.\n\nEmployee Engagement in \nSustainability\nIn 2023, Amazon launched the Sustainable Amazonian (SAM) \nprogram to engage our corporate employees worldwide in \nadopting more sustainable practices, both in their day-to-day \njobs and outside of work. Approximately\u00a07,540\u00a0employees \nsigned the SAM Pledge, which included making a \ncommitment to leave things better than they found them \nand completing a sustainability training. \n\nThrough Amazon\u2019s Sustainability Ambassador \nprogram, operational employees across our business \nsupport\u00a0sustainability projects\u2014both on-site at Amazon \ncampuses and in their communities\u2014as well as employee \nengagement reporting and educational events to inspire \nfellow employees and share best practices across teams, \nbusiness units, and locations. Nearly\u00a09,300 employees \n\nparticipated in our Sustainability Ambassador program \nin 2023, spanning 24 chapters throughout 1,345 of our \nbuildings in our corporate, data center, and fulfillment \nnetworks. Examples of 2023 employee-led projects include:\n\n\u2022  Sustainability Ambassadors established a waste \n\ndiversion program for our EU Logistics organization that \nreduced waste by 1.4 grams per dispatched shipment, \nfor a total of 6\u00a0tons of waste avoided. The team\u2019s waste \navoidance projects helped us divert 88% of waste from \nlandfills in 2023. \n\n\u2022  AWS Sustainability Ambassadors continued their \n\nimplementation of the LED Everywhere Project, an \ninitiative started in 2021 that aims to replace fluorescent \nor less energy-efficient lighting with LED alternatives \nin all AWS data centers. In 2023,\u00a010,500 light bulbs \nwere replaced with LEDs, resulting in an energy use \nreduction of over 3,100 megawatt-hours (MWh) annually \ncompared to the old bulbs.\n\n\u2022  In the U.S., Sustainability Ambassadors partnered with \n\nthe Indigenous at Amazon global affinity group and \nAmazon in the Community to host an in-person panel \ndiscussion with internationally recognized Indigenous \nleaders at our Seattle headquarters. Their discussion \nlinked Indigenous wisdom, knowledge, and learnings to \nglobal sustainability efforts, with a focus on protecting \nour water resources.\n\nThe education of our employees is an important\u00a0piece \nof our work to drive a culture that prioritizes \nsustainability\u00a0across Amazon. In 2023, nearly \n51,300\u00a0employees engaged in sustainability education, \nand approximately\u00a031,680\u00a0voluntarily completed internal \nsustainability training modules.\n\nInclusive ExperiencesHealth and SafetyEmployee Experience2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue Chain2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n79\n79\n\nUpskilling Our Employees \nWe are empowering our employees to build the skills they need to remain competitive, grow their careers, and move into higher-paying \nroles. In the process, we\u2019re building a strong pipeline of talent to fill current and future in-demand jobs, both at Amazon and beyond.\n\nCentral to our upskilling efforts is our pledge to invest $1.2 billion to provide prepaid education and technical skills training to over \n300,000 of our U.S. employees by 2025. We achieved this goal by the end of 2023\u2014with approximately 358,180 U.S. employees \nparticipating in our upskilling programs. Career Choice, our longest-standing program, has provided job training to more than 175,000 \nemployees worldwide since it launched in 2012, a 62% increase from 110,000 in 2022. In 2023, Surge2IT, a program to help entry-level \nIT\u00a0employees across Amazon\u2019s operations pursue careers in higher-paying technical roles, merged into Career Choice.\n\n2023 Upskilling Programs\n\nAmazon Technical\nAcademy\n\nAmazon Technical Academy is a virtual, full-time, tuition-free training program designed to prepare\nemployees\u2014many of whom previously worked in non-technical roles\u2014with the skills needed to become\nAmazon Software Development Engineers. In 2024, this program will integrate with other Amazon \nupskilling programs to provide greater accessibility to Amazon employees.\n\nCareer Choice\n\nAmazon Technical\nApprenticeship \nProgram\n\nThe Amazon Technical Apprenticeship Program helps employees transition into technology careers by\noffering them paid opportunities to learn new skills and get on-the-job training.

This includes direct daily engagement, such as all-\nhands meetings with general managers, stand-up meetings \nwith direct supervisors, and other one-on-one meetings. \n\nEmployees\u00a0can also voice concerns, anonymously report \npotential violations of Amazon\u2019s Code of Business Conduct \nand Ethics, and ask questions about potentially unethical \nconduct through Amazon\u2019s Ethics Line. If needed, employees \ncan access several other escalation mechanisms, including \nexecutive escalation and communication with their managers \nor human resources business partners. We actively encourage \nour employees to report any issues or concerns without fear \nof reprisal, intimidation, or harassment. \n\nMyVoice\n\nMyVoice, Amazon\u2019s primary Voice of Associate platform, \nprovides a two-way communication channel between our \nglobal associates and their site leadership. This online tool \nallows employees to express concerns, offer suggestions, and \nask questions to leadership teams who will reply directly, \nenabling quicker, more collaborative issue remediation. \nGlobally, employees provided over 600,000\u00a0comments \nthrough MyVoice in 2023. \n\nWe also completed a foundational re-architecture of the \nMyVoice tool and integrated it within our A to Z employee \napp, creating a mobile experience for employees that is \nsimpler, is more user-friendly, and increases discoverability. \nOur enhancements to MyVoice also simplify the experience \nfor leaders, centralizing feedback and associated follow-up \n\nactions and making it easier for leaders to review comments \nand track actions.\n\nUsing the MyVoice mechanism, we continuously improve our \npolicies and practices based on workers\u2019 suggestions. For \nexample, direct suggestions relating to time-tracking led \nto policy improvements that better served associate needs, \nprovided increased flexibility, and allowed for better work/\nlife balance. \n\nAt one fulfillment center in California, we received \nMyVoice feedback regarding difficulty in commuting to \nthe location. Taking this feedback into account, Amazon \npartnered with city and local officials to provide a better \nbus route and stop that would help alleviate the issue. \nMeanwhile, in India, leaders analyzed feedback from \nassociates related to leave management, resulting in the \nlaunch of a new, automatic, end-to-end leave management \nsystem, improved standardization, and, as a result, a better \nassociate\u00a0experience.\n\nConnections\u00a0\n\nConnections is Amazon\u2019s real-time, companywide feedback \nmechanism designed to facilitate listening to and learning \nfrom employees at scale. Each day, employees can choose \nto respond to Connections questions\u2014delivered in \n29\u00a0languages\u2014via their computers, workstation devices, \nor hand scanners. Connections improves the employee \nexperience by identifying obstacles to meaningful work, \nsurfacing issues before they become acute problems, \nand highlighting strengths so they don\u2019t become \nmissed\u00a0opportunities.\n\nAcross Amazon, our employees generate more than \n1.6\u00a0million Connections responses across 60 countries \neach day. Connections analyzes and aggregates individual \nresponse data, sharing it with managers at the team \nlevel to maintain confidentiality. Managers can then take \nrelevant actions for improvement at the earliest opportunity \nto build trust with their teams. For example, as a result \nof Connections feedback that both career growth and \nperceptions of growth were important drivers of employee \n\nsatisfaction, Amazon introduced a new program allowing \nemployees and their managers to work together to drive \ncareer growth more\u00a0effectively.\n\nAssociate Roundtables, Forums, and Safety \nCommittees\n\nAssociate Roundtables provide employees and managers \nwith a meaningful opportunity to discuss issues, ask \nquestions, and get immediate feedback in person. Amazon \nhosts these meetings around the globe, with their exact \ncadence varying by business line and site.\n\nAssociate Forums create opportunities for employees \nto connect with site leaders on decisions that affect \nthe site or employee experience. In 2023, we held \n146\u00a0Associate\u00a0Forums.\n\nAssociate Safety Committees allow employees at various \nsites globally to offer input on relevant safety matters. In \n2023, 185,000 employees participated in over\u00a025,000 Safety \nCommittee meetings, collectively developing\u00a013,000\u00a0actions \nto increase on-site safety. \n\nAppeals \n\nAmazon maintains a defined appeals process for our \nemployees. Across the U.S. and Canada, eligible employees \ncan use an online, paperless appeals service to challenge \ncertain disciplinary actions. The applicable manager reviews \nthe claim to verify policies have been correctly applied. \nWhere this is not the case, appropriate remediation can then \nbe taken. \n\nLearn more about our approach to ethical business in our \nSustainability Reporting Framework Summary\u00a0\n\nFreedom of Association \nWe respect freedom of association and our employees\u2019 \nright to form, join, or not join labor unions or other lawful \norganizations of their choosing without fear of reprisal, \n\nintimidation, or harassment. These rights should be exercised \nin an informed and thoughtful manner. \n\nGlobally, Amazon applies or is party to dozens of collective \nbargaining agreements at national, regional, sectoral, \nand enterprise levels. In 2022, we established a European \nWorks Council, holding our first meeting in April 2023. \nThe European Works Council is composed of workers and \nemployer representatives and meets regularly\u00a0to discuss \ntransnational company issues.\u00a0\n\nLearn more about our respect for freedom of association in \nour Human Rights Commitment\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nLooking\u00a0Forward\nAmazon is always exploring new ways to enhance the \nemployee experience. We will continue focusing on upward \nmobility by offering technical and skills training for career \nadvancement and encouraging participation in our Career \nChoice program, which provides employees the opportunity \nto get prepaid college, GED, or English as a second language \n(ESL) tuition. Finally, as we strive to be Earth\u2019s best employer, \nwe\u2019ll seek to further integrate flexibility into how and when \nour employees work and will continue to offer competitive \ncompensation, financial support, and benefits. We\u2019re eager to \nkeep improving our employee engagement efforts and build \neven more robust feedback mechanisms to ensure that our \nglobal workforce feels valued, heard, and appreciated.\n\nInclusive ExperiencesHealth and SafetyEmployee Experience2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue Chain2023 Amazon Sustainability Report \f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n81\n\nHealth and \nSafety\n\nAmazon\u2019s people are the heart and soul of our \noperations and the reason that safety is integral \nto everything we do. We strive to be the safest \nplace to work in the industries in which we \noperate, and we\u2019re committed to making sure our \nemployees\u2019 health and well-being are prioritized. \nWe are continuously working to enhance our \nsafety processes, leveraging technology to reduce \nrisk, investing in areas where we must improve, \npartnering with others, and listening to our \nemployees.

To drive continuous improvement, we \nmeasure progress against both lagging indicators, such as \nincident rates, and leading indicators, such as employee \nsentiment. We have safety audits, inspections, and \nfeedback mechanisms in place at every Amazon facility. \nTogether, these steps provide us with a full picture of our \nworkplace\u00a0safety.\n\nA risk management approach guides our prioritization and \ndecision-making. It includes:\n\n\u2022  Engaging employees to continuously improve safety in \n\nour operations.\n\n\u2022  Assessing safety processes and adherence to standards \n\nthrough audits and inspections.\n\n\u2022  Measuring safety performance to assess program \n\neffectiveness and identify and remove hazards.\n\n\u2022  Working with our operations partners to enhance safety \n\nacross our network. \n\n\u2022  Making targeted investments to enhance our \n\nsafety\u00a0performance.\n\nA management system aligned with International \nOrganization for Standardization (ISO) 45001:2018\u2014a \nvoluntary international standard for health and safety \nmanagement\u2014helps guide our efforts in these areas.  \n\nIn 2023, we continued to invest in capital improvements, new \nsafety technology, vehicle safety controls, and engineered \nergonomic solutions. All of these actions aim to reduce risks \nand hazards for our employees, partners, and communities.\nSupporting Our Operations and \nWorkforce Safety\nCreating a culture where every employee feels engaged \nand empowered is essential to providing and maintaining a \nsafe environment. We have established a series of feedback \nmechanisms to ensure we listen to our people on the front \nlines and incorporate their feedback on ways to improve \nsafety across our operations. \n\nSafety Observations\n\nOne method we use to take employee feedback and turn \nit into measurable action is Dragonfly. This tool\u2014available \non employees\u2019 devices and at kiosks on-site\u2014empowers \nemployees to find and fix unsafe conditions or behaviors, \nescalate safety concerns, and suggest safety improvements \nduring the course of their work. Dragonfly informs site \nmanagers so they can take appropriate action. In 2023, we \nsuccessfully actioned over 200,000 Dragonfly observations \nto help make our sites safer. \n\nSafety Committees\n\nThroughout 2023, more than 185,000 employees \nparticipated in over 25,000 safety meetings whose purpose \nwas to gather feedback, describe new safety initiatives, and \nlisten to employee needs. These meetings resulted in more \nthan 13,000 follow-up actions, including simple items like \nreadjusting site mirrors to better align with walking paths \nand sharing reminders on how to safely move pallets.\n\nSafety Leadership Index\n\nContinuous Learning\n\nAnother tool that we use to measure and improve safety is \nthe Safety Leadership Index (SLI). SLI helps us get ahead of \nsafety risks by receiving information from our employees \nthrough a monthly rotation of questions that pop up on \nemployees\u2019 scanners and computers when they log in for \nwork. Feedback is anonymous, confidential, and crucial to \ndriving continuous improvement. \n\nTraining Our Employees \nTraining is foundational to safety excellence. We are \nconstantly updating and enhancing our suite of trainings to \nensure they are effective and helpful for employees. \n\nOnboarding\n\nAll applicable new employees receive safety training on their \nfirst day of employment. In 2023, all of our newly hired \noperations employees took our safety onboarding training. \nThis covers ownership of safety, incident reporting and \ninvestigation, stop work authority, awareness for all safety \nprocedures, and an introduction to the safety management \nsystem. We also review emergency response preparedness \ntraining, which includes a site tour and a review of specific \nshelter-in-place and incident response procedures. To make \nsure that we are listening to employees\u2019 feedback from \ntheir first day on the job, we ask whether their training has \nprepared them to perform their jobs safely. Nearly 89% of \nthose who responded to the survey told us that the training \nprepared them to do their jobs safely.\n\nAfter orientation, training continues with routine reminders \ndelivered through daily stand-up meetings, notifications \nin the A to Z employee app, messages on TV screens in \nour buildings, alerts when logging on to a workstation, \ne-learning modules, and wall posters in restrooms, break \nrooms, and other common areas. We also coach small groups \nof employees on body mechanics, proactive wellness, and \nsafety through our Huddles program. Managers cover a \nrotating set of topics that includes proper body movement, \nconditioning, and best practices for gripping, handling \nobjects, lifting, carrying, and bending. Employees also receive \nother training based on their job duties, including training \nmodules specific to dock safety, powered industrial trucks, \nand first aid.\n\nAnnual Training\n\nEvery employee and manager participates in annual safety \ntraining, which reinforces concepts such as emergency \npreparedness and response, hazards and controls of the \nspecific jobs they are doing, safety coaching, identifying \nand reporting unsafe conditions and behaviors, and safety \nengagement. This goes beyond merely teaching someone the \nskills they need to complete a specific task. We incorporate \nreal-world scenarios, with practical opportunities to practice \nwhat they have learned. \n\nMixed Reality Training\n\nBeyond routine training, we invest in new technologies to \ncontinuously build safety skills and competencies. We are \npiloting promising mixed reality training for some higher-\nrisk jobs to simulate real-world scenarios in a controlled, safe \nenvironment. For example, we are testing a semi-immersive \n\nInclusive ExperiencesHealth and SafetyEmployee Experience2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue Chain\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n83\n\ntraining for our new forklift operators. Using 3D headsets to \nsimulate their jobs, operators learn how to pick orders in a \nsafe and efficient way before starting their roles. \n\nOur Partners \n\nOur delivery network is powered by thousands of small \nbusinesses and hundreds of thousands of drivers who \nleverage Amazon\u2019s technology to improve on-road safety \nevery day. While our partners each provide robust programs \nfor their drivers, we offer additional safety resources and \ntraining for any delivery partner\u00a0who wants to participate. \nFor example, to help drivers practice how to navigate safely \nin a variety of weather conditions, we created a commercial \ndriver simulator program that includes advanced simulations \nof potential ice, snow, heavy rain, wind, mechanical \nchallenges, and tire failures. \n\nExamining Injuries at Amazon \nFacilities\u00a0\nIn addition to looking at overall injury rates, we believe it is \nimportant to examine the types and frequency of injuries \nto help us prevent incidents from occurring in the first \nplace. That is why we rigorously audit and inspect our sites \nto make sure our resources and protocols are helping us \neffectively identify, eliminate, or reduce safety hazards. In \n2023, we conducted almost 6.3 million inspections within \nour operations facilities globally, a 152% increase from \nthe 2.5 million conducted in 2020. We audited 240 sites \nacross\u00a0Amazon. \n\nThese inspections and audits help us determine how to \naddress the various types of injury. One of the most common \ntypes of injury at any warehousing or transportation \ncompany is a musculoskeletal disorder (MSD), more \ncommonly known as a strain or sprain. Over the past four \nyears, the rate of recordable MSD injuries at Amazon has \n\nimproved by\u00a027%, but they still make up about 57% of \nall recordable injuries at Amazon. The remaining 43% of \nour recordable injuries were due to slips, trips, and falls, or \noccasional objects that came loose and fell. \n\nTo continue reducing MSD injuries, we have devoted \nconsiderable effort and resources to improve ergonomic \nconditions. In 2023, we invested in technology and \nworkspace modifications that specifically target MSD risk \nreduction. For example, we: \n\n\u2022  Introduced sophisticated computer algorithms in our \nfulfillment centers that direct employees to pick and \nstow products in ergonomic power zones\u2014the area \nbetween the shoulder and mid-thigh. As a result, there \nwas an average 5% improvement in the cumulative \nforces acting on the lower back and an average \n7%\u00a0improvement on shoulder movements.  \n\n\u2022  Implemented adjustable-height workstations at select \n\nfulfillment centers. \n\n\u2022  Deployed ergonomically redesigned packing stations at \n\nselect fulfillment centers.\n\n\u2022  Introduced self-adjusting carts that enable employees to \n\nhandle totes (plastic bins used to move products) in an \nergonomically friendly way.\n\n\u2022  Implemented job rotations, where employees are \n\ntrained in new roles and can rotate among jobs that \nuse different muscle-tendon groups, in some facilities. \nBy doing this, we help decrease repetitive motion and \nprevent muscle fatigue.\n\nEvaluating Our Safety \nPerformance\u00a0\nOur global operations network more than doubled in size \nbetween 2019 and 2023 to more than 1.1 million employees \nacross thousands of sites. \n\nWhile we still have work to do, we have made significant \nprogress on safety since 2019. From the beginning of \n2019 to the end of 2023, our global Recordable Incident \nRate (RIR) improved by 30% and our Lost Time Incident \nRate (LTIR) improved by 60%. These safety improvements \ncame in the face of particularly tumultuous world events, \nincluding a pandemic that disrupted operations for almost \nevery employer. Amazon\u2019s safety performance continues to \nimprove year over year\u2014from\u00a02022 to 2023, we improved \nour RIR by 8% and our LTIR by 16%. We are pleased with our \nprogress but know we can do more. Each incident that occurs \nrepresents a person, and even one incident is too many.\n\nLearn more about how\u00a0Amazon\u2019s safety performance \ncontinues to improve year over year\u00a0\n\nSafety in the United States\n\nIn the U.S., we report our operations data to the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration under \ntwo distinct industries: General Warehousing and Storage, \nand Courier and Express Delivery Services. The Bureau of \nLabor Statistics (BLS) determines industry averages for \neach industry based on the employers\u2019 size and categorizes \nthem accordingly. BLS publishes averages each November, \nmeaning the 2022 averages published in November 2023 are \nthe most\u00a0recent.\n\nSimilar to our global operations, we have made meaningful, \nmeasurable safety progress in the U.S. over the past four \nyears.

We have also continued to invest in\u00a0robotics that \n by reducing employees\u2019 \nhelp make our operations safer\u00a0\nworkloads. One example is Proteus, our first autonomous \nmobile robot, which helps move heavy objects and carts. \nAnother is Cardinal, a robotic arm that can quickly select a \nsingle package, read its label, and sort it. Both innovations \nhelp reduce repetitive tasks that can cause injuries such \nas MSDs and create a safer, more comfortable work \nenvironment for our employees year-round. We also plan \nfor factors that can impact our employees\u2019 safety such as \nextreme weather. Our policies and procedures for addressing \nextreme heat and cold are robust and often exceed industry \nstandards and guidelines.\n\nWe are proud of our advancements in automation, and we \nsupplement this sophisticated technology with well-known \nforms of personal protection. For example, we require all \nemployees, partners, and visitors to wear safety shoes at our \nfacilities, as well as hard hats and impact-resistant gloves in \nspecific jobs. Mandating composite-toe safety shoes at our \nfacilities has helped reduce toe-related injuries by 85% since \n2022. We provide employees with a $110 voucher annually \nto acquire approved composite-toe shoes that fit their style \nand\u00a0needs.\n\nIn addition, we have developed cutting-edge protective \nequipment for specific jobs. For example, we have developed \nintelligent safety vests for employees who maintain our \nrobots. These vests use short-range radio frequencies to send \nsignals to robots in real time. Robots in range automatically \nslow down, alter their route, and, at even closer range, stop \nentirely when they detect an employee is nearby. Once \nthe employee is out of range, the robot resumes normal \noperation. As another example, we use sensor technology \nembedded in cold weather gear for employees who work \nin our freezers, allowing us to keep an eye on the amount \nof time they spend working in cooler temperatures. If an \nemployee exceeds a specified amount of time, site personnel \n\nInclusive ExperiencesHealth and SafetyEmployee Experience2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue Chain\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n85\n\nreceive a real-time alert to check on the employee and \nencourage them to take a break. Since introducing this \ntechnology in 2022, we have not had a single recordable \ninjury related to overexposure in freezers.\n\nWorking with Our Operations \nPartners\nWithin our operations network, we work with partners \naround the world to deliver packages to our customers \nsafely and efficiently. For example, we collaborate with small \nbusiness owners called delivery service providers (DSPs) and \nwith independent contractors called Amazon Flex delivery \npartners to deliver packages to customers\u2019 doorsteps. We \nalso work with independent long-haul trucking companies to \nmove products across our network.\n\nOur transportation operations blend Amazon\u2019s advanced \ntechnology and safety initiatives to transport packages \nacross our network of fulfillment centers, sort centers, \nand delivery stations, and to our customers. As our \ntransportation operations have expanded, we have focused \non making our docks and roads safer through innovative \nmobile and vehicle technology. \n\nFreight Network\n\nOur trucking fleet of company-owned and independent \nlong-haul vehicles has advanced safety technology including \nfront-collision warning, automatic emergency braking, \nstability control, side-object detection, adaptive cruise \ncontrol, and speed limiters. Drivers in North America and \nEurope receive enhanced and up-to-date route forecasts \nto help them stay informed of inclement weather. The \ninformation can be accessed at any time, and forecasts are \nupdated every 10 minutes to help them alter their route if \nneeded. Drivers in North America also receive automated \nwarnings if the technology detects their vehicle is stopped on \na major road. The technology urges them to move to a safer \nlocation, if possible. \n\nDelivery Network \n\nWhile our partners report their own safety data to \nregulators, we are committed to helping them keep their \nemployees safe. To that end, we offer them access to \nsafety resources, training, and technologies. One example \nis third-party technology in delivery vans that measures \nand monitors unsafe driving behaviors such as speeding, \ndistraction, and failure to wear a seat belt or obey a road \nsign. If the technology consistently detects these behaviors, \ndrivers receive a notification when they stop their vehicle \nfor their next delivery. The technology also sends related \nnotifications to the drivers\u2019 employers\u2014the DSPs\u2014who are \nencouraged to coach the drivers. Since we have incorporated \nthis technology into our branded vehicles, DSP drivers\u2019 \ncollision rates have declined nearly 40%. From 2022 to 2023, \nits use has reduced unsafe DSP driving behaviors by 62% in \nthe U.S.\n\nAs the weather gets warmer, preparedness and prevention \nare paramount to the health and safety of our operations \nteams and delivery partners. In advance of higher \ntemperatures, we use best-in-class technology, amenities, \nand preventive measures to help keep drivers safe. For \nexample, all Amazon-branded vehicles are equipped with \nair conditioning\u2014a feature that is well above industry \nstandards. We are also on track to retrofit our full fleet of \ncargo vans and electric delivery vehicles with insulation that \nreduces the internal temperature of the back of our vehicles \nby up to 15%\u00a0by the end of 2024.\n\nIncreasingly, more package deliveries are made overnight, \nwhen traffic is lighter and drivers can more safely navigate \nacross communities. In 2023, we created an in-app safety \nfeature that allows drivers to message customers and \nremind them to turn on porch lights, secure pets, and clear \nthe pathway of hazards. We have also piloted a safe and \nnon-intrusive Dog-Distancing Device\u2014a hand-held unit \nwith ultrasonic sounds and strobe lights that drivers can \nuse when they come in contact with an animal at a delivery \nlocation. The device is intended to distract aggressive dogs \nand help delivery drivers create space between themselves \n\nand the animals when needed. Based on initial success, we \nhave expanded the test to deploy the devices to the drivers \nwho most frequently report encountering dogs during their \ndeliveries.\n\nLooking Forward\nAs we look to the future, we plan to continue investing \nheavily in employee health and safety across our operations. \nIn 2024 alone, we plan to invest over $750\u00a0million in \ntechnologies, resources, training, and programs to further \nour safety efforts. This includes more than\u00a0$400\u00a0million \n\nfor process engineering and retrofit initiatives that improve \nergonomics, more than $150\u00a0million in additional forklift \nsafety controls, more than $100\u00a0million for on-the-road \nsafety enhancements, and more than $80\u00a0million\u00a0for truck \nyard safety improvements.\n\nWe made meaningful, measurable progress in 2023, and \nwe are working hard to build on those achievements. While \nwe\u2019re proud of the progress we have made, we know that \nthere is more work to do on our journey to become the safest \nemployer in the industries in which we operate, and this \ndrives our commitment to continue improving safety for our \nemployees, partners, and communities every day.\n\nWe offer our freight partners access to safety resources, training, and technologies to keep their employees safe.\n\nInclusive ExperiencesHealth and SafetyEmployee Experience2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue Chain\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n86\n\nGoal\nHire 100,000 U.S. military veterans and military spouses \nby July 2024\n\nGoal\nProvide training for 10,000 Ukrainians globally through \nthe AWS program ITSkills4U by 2024\n\nInclusive \nExperiences\n\nAmazon creates inclusive technology and \nexperiences that connect our diverse world. \nTo guide our work, we set three companywide \npriorities.

We are evolving our \napproach to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) work by \nshifting to a more scalable, long-term view through three new \nmental models. This new strategy enables us to accelerate \nprogress on our priorities and create inclusive experiences at \nscale. The mental models that guide our work are:\n\n\u2022  Bolted-on DEI programs, which drive inclusive and \n\nequitable outcomes within our business operations. An \nexample of a bolted-on program is diversity training, \nwhich teaches our employees to take more intentionally \ninclusive actions at work. \n\n\u2022  Built-in solutions, which are embedded into existing \nproducts to drive equitable experience and outcomes. \nFor example, the captions and dialogue boosts in \nPrime Video are built-in solutions, which create a more \naccessible experience for customers who are hard \nof\u00a0hearing. \n\n\u2022  Born-inclusive solutions, which we define as building \nequity and inclusion into the architecture of a product \nor technology from the start. Examples of this include \naspects of product design, such as accessibility.\n\nMore built-in and born-inclusive solutions will be required \nto accelerate progress on our priorities and create inclusive \nexperiences at scale.\n\nLearn more about Amazon\u2019s approach to inclusion on our \nglobal DEI website\u00a0\n\nAs we deliver on our goals and make progress on our \npriority commitments, we continue reaching across \ncultures to connect our diverse world. We use our size, \nspeed, and innovation to unite us in new and exciting ways, \nincorporating inclusion into everything we do. \n\nhigh schools in underserved communities. Seven different \nAmazon organizations\u2014Devices & Services, Amazon \nAdvertising, AWS, Worldwide Amazon Stores, Finance, Audio, \nand Twitch & Games\u2014provided apprentices with on-the-job \nlearning experiences.\n\nBuilding Equity and Inclusion into \nOur Talent Management \nWe continue to diversify our workforce, inspect outcomes \nof our talent strategies, and experiment with initiatives that \nfoster a diverse talent pipeline and improve the experience \nfor employees\u2014from being hired, to successful onboarding, \nto career development.\n\nBuilding a Diverse Pipeline of Talent\n\nAmazon\u2019s ambition is for our employee population to \nrepresent the diverse communities we serve. As part of our \nefforts, we are building a strong pipeline of emerging diverse \ntalent through educational programs. \n\nIn 2023, more than 300 employees volunteered through the \nAmazon Hardware, Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and \nDevices (AHEAD) program, which gives primary and high \nschool science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) \nstudents hands-on learning through a custom curriculum \nenhanced by Amazon innovation. AHEAD helps historically \nunderrepresented students and their families understand \nthe pathways to high-tech fields by connecting them with \nAmazon employees who can share their own career journeys, \nguidance, and lessons learned. \n\nWe also welcomed 89 youth apprentices in 2023 to Amazon \nJumpStart, a program that employs emerging talent from \n\nDeveloping Diverse Talent\n\nThroughout 2023, Black, Latino/e, and women senior \nleaders across Amazon partnered with our hiring teams to \nsupport the continuous expansion of our external talent \nnetworks by investing in conferences and organizations \nsuch as Afro Tech, Association of Latino Professionals for \nAmerica (ALPFA), Black Men Xcel, Latinas in Tech, Society \nof Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), and Women in \nTech. Amazon senior leaders participated in roundtable \ndiscussions and network-building and affinity-based events, \nand they engaged in recruiting partnerships\u2014all to increase \nbrand awareness, engage diverse talent, and drive expanded \ninteraction with prospective external employees and leaders. \n\nAs we build our talent communities, we aim to create \nspace for our leaders and employees to come together and \nshare experiences and learn about Amazon. For example, \nthe L\u00edderes sponsorship program equips participants with \nthe skill to create a personalized\u00a0career growth plan that \nbuilds on the unique needs of Latino/e talent and creates \nopportunities for participants to have sustained exposure to, \nand advocacy from, senior leaders.\n\nAccelerating Inclusive Experiences \nGlobally\nWe are delivering inclusive experiences for our employees, \ncustomers, and communities in over 60\u00a0countries around \nthe\u00a0world.\n\nOur Employees, Customers, and Communities\n\nTogether at Amazon\nWe want all Amazon employees to feel that they belong. \nThat is why we support programs that connect our \nemployees globally through shared experiences. For \nexample, Connect@Amazon is an employee engagement \norganization that hosts a variety of events for all full-time \nemployees, such as career summits, volunteer activities, \ncultural gatherings, and professional networking. In 2023, \nConnect@Amazon hosted events across\u00a033 chapters with \n80,000 participants worldwide.\n\nEmployees can also participate in networking programs that \norganize learning opportunities, lead service projects, and \nhost activities around cultural celebrations. In 2023, nearly \n148,200 employees across more than 2,500 chapters in 60 \ncountries participated in one or more of our affinity groups. \nAWS employees can take part in the Inclusive Ambassador \nprogram, which is dedicated to scaling an inclusive, fair, and \nrespectful culture at AWS. More than 19,000 AWS employees \nacross 52 chapters globally participated in the Inclusive \nAmbassador program in 2023. \n\nLearn more about Amazon\u2019s affinity groups\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nLGBTQIA+ at Amazon\nWe are committed to supporting and creating inclusive \nexperiences for LGBTQIA+ employees and communities \naround the globe. To advance development and recruitment \nefforts, Amazon strengthened key external LGBTQIA+ \npartnerships and fostered new ones. New partners in \n2023 include the Ali Forney Center, Coqual, myGwork, and \nRainbow Railroad. \n\nWe rolled out new, inclusive self-identification features for \nemployees in 2023, allowing them to easily change their \n\nInclusive ExperiencesHealth and SafetyEmployee Experience2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue Chain\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n88\n\nRefugees and Humanitarian-Based Immigrants\nAs part of our efforts to be Earth\u2019s best employer, we \nwelcome refugees and immigrants into our workforce and \nsupport their transition to their new communities. In 2022, \nwe announced a goal to hire at least 5,000 refugees in the \nU.S. by the end of 2024\u2014and we achieved this in 2023. \n\nWomen at Amazon\nAmazon celebrates women around the world and aims to \ninspire the next generation of women in tech. We advocate \nfor gender diversity, equal opportunities, and inclusive \nspaces for women to thrive and feel comfortable at work \nand\u00a0beyond.\n\n program, which offers resources \n\nTo support this hiring commitment, in 2023, we expanded \nour Welcome Door\u00a0\nand support for refugee and humanitarian-based \nimmigrant employees in the U.S., to Germany, Poland, \nand Australia. Benefits vary by country (based on need) \nbut may include financial reimbursement for immigration-\nrelated processes, free legal resources to help navigate \nimmigration-related questions, the option to connect with \nimmigration experts, access to upskilling opportunities, and \ncustomized\u00a0mentorship.\n\nThrough the AWS program ITSkills4U, AWS provides virtual \nand in-person training to people who are interested in \nexpanding their job opportunities in non-IT roles, switching \nto IT, or advancing their IT careers. By the end of 2023, \nITSkills4U had provided training to nearly 16,500 Ukrainians \nglobally, including refugees\u2014exceeding AWS\u2019s goal of \ntraining 10,000 Ukrainians.\n\nVeterans and Military Spouses\u00a0at Amazon\nWe recognize the diverse backgrounds and experiences that \nveterans and military spouses bring to Amazon, as well as \nhow they strengthen our workforce. Amazon partners across \nbusiness lines to host hiring events, such as Amazon Military \nHiring Days and virtual information sessions.\n\nAmazon hired over 100,400 veterans and spouses through \nJanuary 2024, achieving our goal to hire 100,000 veterans \nand spouses by July 2024. At the end of 2023, Amazon \nemployed 98,500 veterans and military spouses, based \non data from countries where employees can identify \nthemselves as such. In addition, our veteran retention and \npromotion rates outpaced those of\u00a0non-veterans.  \n\nIn 2023, our Women at Amazon affinity group hosted \ndevelopment programs across Amazon, such as its \nSponsorship and Promotion Accelerating Readiness and \nKnow-How (SPARK) initiative. This program offers employees \naccess to formal training and development, influence and \nadvocacy, networking opportunities with senior leaders, and \ntargeted, actionable coaching. In 2023, SPARK onboarded \n300 participants across eight countries. \n\nWe also focus on investing in women as community members \nthat contribute to industry innovation through initiatives that \nhelp close funding gaps. For example, in 2023, we held our \nfirst-ever AWS Startups Women\u2019s Demo Week\u00a0\n, a global \nevent helping women-led startups connect with investors. \nAdditionally, we are committed to supporting women climate \ntech entrepreneurs through The Climate Pledge Fund\u2019s \nFemale Founder Initiative. In 2023, the Female Founder \nInitiative invested in Genecis\u00a0\n, a bioplastics company \nfounded by scientist Luna Yu.\n\nLearn more about how we are accelerating climate \nsolutions from female founders through The Climate \nPledge Fund\u00a0\n\nIndigenous Communities\nAmazon is committed to supporting Indigenous leaders and \ncreating solutions to help close educational and professional \ngaps among members of Indigenous communities.

We \ndeliver and invest in tools and resources that empower \nbusiness owners to grow and, in turn, create positive impact \nin their local communities. \n\nIn 2023, as part of our efforts to boost and support \nearly-stage, Black, Latino, and other underrepresented \nentrepreneurs, Amazon Catalytic Capital invested in\u00a0six new \nventure capital funds. Catalytic Capital is a $150 million fund \ncommitted to investing in venture capital funds, accelerators, \nincubators, and venture studios that support Black, Latino, \nand other historically underrepresented entrepreneurs. These \nnew investments helped us meet our goal to support 10 \nfunds and accelerators and, in turn, fund 200 companies by \nthe end of 2023.\n\nLearn more about Catalytic Capital\u00a0\n\nWe are also creating opportunities for alignment with \nthe greater community through programs such as our \nBlack Business Accelerator\u00a0\n (BBA), which was launched \nin 2021 as our first growth accelerator. Backed by a $150 \nmillion\u00a0commitment from Amazon over four years, the BBA \nis dedicated to assisting Black-owned businesses in building \nsustainable growth on Amazon\u2019s store. It provides a range of \ncomprehensive educational, discoverability, and community \nresources for certified Black-owned U.S. businesses with \nprofessional seller accounts at our store. In 2023, the BBA \nprovided 274 businesses with account management and \nfinancial assistance to accelerate their journey to launch \nand scale their businesses. Through the BBA, Amazon has \n\nincreased the unique selection of products we bring to \nour customers while creating a network with the Black \nbusiness community to better understand and support their \nentrepreneurial endeavors.\n\nAnother example is the AWS Impact Accelerator, a \n$30\u00a0million fund that provides Black, Latino/e, women, and \nLGBTQIA+ founders with equitable access to funds, training, \nmentorship, tools, and resources. In 2023, 20 companies \nparticipated in the AWS Impact Accelerator Latino Founders \nCohort, giving pre-seed Latino/e founders the support they \nneed to accelerate their businesses.\n\nLearn more about our efforts to support diverse  \nbusinesses\u00a0\n\nAdvancing DEI through \nTechnology \nAmazon is creating inclusive technology that connects our \ndiverse world, disrupting the status quo of how we learn, \ncommunicate, and live. \n\n \n\nInnovating for Accessibility\n\nIn everything we do, we work backward from our customers. \nThis includes offering more devices and services with built-\nin accessibility solutions to better support our customers \nwith disabilities. Within Amazon\u2019s devices and entertainment \nbusinesses, we continue to build and expand accessibility \nfeatures in our products, from Alexa and Fire TV to Audible \nand Prime Video. For example, we offer Alexa Voice Service \n(AVS) to commercial device makers such as original design \nmanufacturers and systems integrators, who use it to build \nAlexa into smart speakers, headphones, PCs, TVs, vehicles, \nand smart home products. We also launched Voice Access, a \nnew accessibility feature for our Fire HD 10, in October 2023. \nVoice Access allows customers who can speak English, but \ncannot use their hands to touch the screen, to control their \nFire tablet with their voice.\n\nAccelerating Equitable Health Research\n\nMany communities are currently underrepresented \nin medical research. As a result, less is known \nabout their health and ways to provide them \nwith the best care. In September 2023, we began \na partnership with the National Institutes of \nHealth (NIH) to raise awareness of their All of Us \nResearch Program, an effort to collect and study \ndata from people living in the U.S. to build one \nof the most diverse health databases in history. \nThis initiative focuses on accelerating precision \nmedicine research, increasing health equity, \nand providing DNA results to participants. In \nsupport of this work, All of Us works closely with \norganizations with deep ties to communities \nthat have been historically underrepresented in \nbiomedical\u00a0research. \n\nWe were NIH\u2019s first corporate health equity \npartner. In 2023, more than 1,300\u00a0Amazon \nemployees have either visited the All of Us \nwebsite or interacted directly with All of Us staff \nto learn more about the program, and more \nthan 200 Amazon employees have participated \nin this landmark study. Of the participants who \njoined a kickoff event at our second corporate \nheadquarters in Arlington, Virginia, 79% are \nfrom communities that have been historically \nunderrepresented in biomedical research.\n\nInclusive ExperiencesHealth and SafetyEmployee Experience2023 Amazon Sustainability Report OverviewEnvironmentValue Chain\f##PAGE_BREAK##People\n\nAppendix\n\n92\n\ntranslators.

In \n2022, Amazon conducted a comprehensive analysis to inform \nthe sustainability topics that are relevant to our reporting. \n\nTo guide our analysis, we leveraged Datamaran, a business \nintelligence platform, referencing data-driven insights from \nleading reporting frameworks, including the Sustainability \nAccounting Standards Board (SASB), the Task Force on \nClimate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and the \nGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI). The platform also \nanalyzed the regulatory landscape, media, and company \nreports to inform the topics. We also consulted with key \nstakeholders, including internal decision-makers, employees, \npartner organizations, nongovernmental organizations, \nand academics, to capture their input and broad range \nof\u00a0perspectives. \n\nAs a result, we have included a number of topics in our \nreporting, listed below in alphabetical order.
